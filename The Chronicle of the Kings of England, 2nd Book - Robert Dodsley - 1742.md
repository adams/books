THE SECOND BOOK
OF THE
CHRONICLE
OF THE
KINGS of ENGLAND

XXIV. James I.

And Jamie thought himself a bonny King, and a mickle wise Mon. Howbeit he was a Fool and a Pedant.

But the Spirit of Flattery went forth in the Land, and the great Men and the Bishops offered Incense unto him, saying,

O most sacred King! Thou art wiser than the Children of Men! thou speakest by the Spirit of God!

There has been none equal to thee before thee, neither will any arise after thee like unto thee.

Thus they abused him daily with lying and fulsome Adulation.

And the Ear of James was tickled therewith, and he was puffed up, and he thought himself wise; whereupon he began to dispute with the Doctors, and to decide Controversies, and to write Books; and the World was undeceived.

Howbeit a new Translation of the Bible was set on foot in his Reign, and it was executed with great Care and Exactness, and the same is read by the People unto this Day.

In this Reign also the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland were united together, andhe gave unto them the Name of Great Britain; and the two Nations became as one People.

Moreover he issued a Proclamation to enforced the Act of Uniformity; and of ten thousand pious Ministers that dispensed the Word, but forty and nine were found that did not conform.

And the forty and nine who had Consciences were suspended; but the nine thousand fifty and one, who had no Conscience, were continued as faithful Ministers of the Word.

And it came to pass in the third Year of his Reign, that the Pope and the Devil laid their Heads together, and contrived a most grievous Plot.

And the Pope said unto the Devil, Wherewith shall we destroy him? And the Devil said unto the Pope, I will do it with Gunpowder.

Howbeit the Wisdom of James was greater than the Wisdom of the Pope and the Devil, and he smelled out their Plot, and prevented it.

And James was glad that he was alive; therefore he appointed the fifth Day of the Month November as a Day of Thanksgiving for ever. And Bonfires are made, and Squibs and Crackers are let off in the Streets, in Derision of the Devil and his Gunpowder Plot unto this Day.

Now James the King was of a sociable and loving Nature, and he could not be without a Bosom Friend with whom he might communicate his internos sensus, and upon whose Shoulders he might sometimes lay a Burden which he was not willing to bear himself.

Wherefore he cast an Eye of Favour upon Sir Robert Carr, a Gentleman of Scotland, of such exquisite Beauty, and so delicate a Composure of Body, as if Nature had framed him on purpose to be a King's Favourite.

And the King loved him, and he pleased the King; nor was any Man Partaker of the Royal Influence like unto him, all Matters of Grace and Favour passing from the King by him, insomuch that the Queen was jealous.

Moreover it came to pass, that on Easter Monday, in the Year One thousand six undred and eleven, for his great Services done unto the King, he was created Viscount Rochester; on the two and twentieth of April, One thousand six hundred and twelve, he was sworn a Privy Counsellor; on the fourth of November, One thousand six hundred and thirteen, he was created Earl of Somerset; and on the tenth of July following, he was made Lord Chamberlain; so true is that Saying,

Improbe amor, quod non mortalia pectora cogis?

But this Sunshine of Konstone(?) lasted not long; whether the King grew weary of him, as not being so agreeable as when he was first taken into Favour, or whether the Machinations of the jealous Queen wrought his Destruction, we cannot say; but being suspected of contriving the Death of Sir Thomas Overbury by Poison, he was arraigned and condemned for the same; and though, through the Clemency of the King, his Life was spared, he was never after suffered to see the King's Face, nor to come over(?) to his Court.

Howbeit, the King could not be long without an Alter idem; wherefore he took unto himself a beautiful Youth named George Villiers; and he loaded him with Honours, and used him in all Respects like unto the other.

And James believed himself a great King, and conceived high Notions of the Royal Prerogative; insomuch that he looked upon the Parliament as a troublesome and unnecessary Thing; and thought it extremely hard, that so great a King should be bound by the Laws of the Land, or his Corronation Oath, or that he should be obliged to call a Parliament to make Laws, when he might do it alone by his absolute Power.

Moreover, he approved the Book of Doctor Blackwood, which laid it down as a Principle, that the English were all Slaves by reason of the Norman Conquest.

With these Notions he poisoned himself and his Son, and laid the Foundation of those Troubles which ended in the Ruin of his Family.

And it came to pass in these Days, that a certain Impostor, named Richard Hadock, pretended to preach in his Sleep, in such sort, that though he were called aloud, or stirred and pulled by the Hands or Feet, yet he seemed not to hear or to feel.

And he continued to do this in the Presence of many Persons who resorted to hear him; insomuch that in a short Time his Fame was spread through the Land by the Name of the sleeping Preacher, and many were brought to believe that these his mighty Preachings were by Inspiration from Heaven.

Tantum Religio potuit suadere Foolorum?

But the King discovered the Cheat, and commanded him in all Places to declare himself an Impostor.

Howbeit, the Race of Reverend Sleepers continue, and infest the Land with large long-laboured Volumes of heavy and somniferous Lumber unto this Day.

And it came to pass in the seventeenth Year of the Reign of King James, that the Wife of his Bosom fell sick, and her Sickness was unto Death.

Then James the King was sore troubled, and he put on Sackcloth and bewailed himself; and so great was his Sorrow, that he spake not, neither did he eat for many Days.

Howbeit, he was a wife Man, and he said within himself, Why should I be any longer troubled, or why should my Spirit be sunk within me? Our Tears avail not to the Dead, neither do they hear our Cries.

Sorrow dimmeth the Eyes, and Grief withereth the Countenance, but the Smile of a Friend reviveth the Heart.

So the King arose, and washed himself, and did eat Bread.

Now the rest of the Acts of King James, and his Wisdom, and his Learning, and all the Books that he wrote, behold thou mayst find them in the Chandlers Shops unto this Day.

And James slept with his Fathers, after he had reigned over England twenty and two Years, and Charles his Son reigned in his stead.

XXV. Charles I.

And Charles was tenty and five Years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over England twenty and two Years and ten Months, and his Mother's Name was Anne.

And he was a pious and religious Prince, and wrote many godly Books; Hymns also and Prayers, and sundry Meditations were the Works of his Hands.

Howbeit he did that which was Evil in the sight of the Lord, in following the Steps of his Father, and aspiring to absolute Power.

And the Anger of the Lord was kindled against him, and he caused a Spirit of Discontent to go forth among the People, and they came unto the King and besought him, saying:

Most gracious Sovereign! incline thine Ears, we beseech thee, unto the Voice of thy People, and let their Cry come unto thee: Behold we are a free People, we and our Fathers have been free Men unto this Day.

Wherefore now then are we oppressed with arbitrary Power, with forced Loans, with Tonnage and Poundage, with Ship-money, and with divers Taxes imposed on us without the Authority of Parliament?

[ 47 ]

Wherefore is the Yoke of Bondage laid upon us? a Yoke which we nor our Fathers were able to bear.

Howbeit this Remonstrance pleased not the King, neither was he moved therewith, except unto Wrath; moreover he dissolved the Parliament, and continued in his evil Ways.

Then the Anger of the People waxed great, and they said amongst themselves, The King is ill advised, his Counsellors are naught; let us remove the Wicked from before the King, and his Throne shall be established in Righteousness.

So they accused Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, who was the King's prime Favourite and chief Minister, of divers Crimes and Misdemeanours; namely, that he engrossed into his Hands, by evil Means, a great Number of Offices and Employments, some wehreof could hardly be executed by a single Person: That he favoured and promoted the Worship of Rome: That he neglected to guard the Seas and protect the Merchants: That he constrained several Persons to purchase Titles of Honour, particularly the Lord Robartes of Truro, whom he enfroced to pay Ten thousand Pounds for the Title of Baron: That he procured to his Kindred and Allies, and other unworthy Persons, many Titles and Honours, without their having done the State any Service: With divers notorious Crimes and Heinous Offences.

Wherefore they most humbly besought the King, even for his own Honour and the Honour of Almighty God, for the Safety and Welfare of his Kingdom, and for the Love which as a kind Father he bore unto his People, that he would be graciously pleased to remove this Person from Access to his sacred

[ 48 ]

Presence, and that he would not balance this one Man with all these Things: protesting, that until this great Man was removed from intermeddling with the Affairs of State, they were out of all Hopes of any good Success.

Nevertheless their Petition was rejected.

Moreover the King was exceeding wroth, and he commanded the Petition to be consumed with Fire, and all the Copies thereof to be destroyed. And he protected his Favourite from the publick Rage.

Howbeit he escaped not the Hand of Justice; for the Anger of the Lord was kindled against him, and he stirred up the Zeal o fFelton the Lieutenant, who smote him to the Heart that he died.

And it came to pass in these Days, that great Troubles arose in Egnland on account of Religion: many, being smitten with the Tinsel Beauties of the Church of Rome, went a whoring after her Gods, and gave up their Hearts unto the Lusts thereof.

And, forasmuch as many Tokens of his Love appeared, it was thought that Laud the Archbishop was corrupted by her Fornications, that he had bowed the Knee unto her Idols, and lusted in his Heart after her Abominations.

Certain it is, he was very punctual in observing all the superstitious Gestures, the Bowings, the Washings, the Vestments, and all the painted Ornaments in which the scarlet Whore delighteth.

And he drew many after him, and occasioned much Trouble in the Land, and much Nonsesnse, and many trifling Disputes.

Moreover he was suspected of debauching the King into his lewd Amour, and imposing on his Royal

[ 49 ]

Affections with the Paint and Patches of his inveigling Harlot. Wherefore the People rose up against Laud, and in the Fury of their Zeal they put him to Death.

Now these Things were done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his Garments, lest he walk naked and they see his Shame.

ANd it came to pass that the whole Kingdom was possessed by two evil Spirits, the Spirit of Prelacy and the Spirit of Fanaticism. And the two Spirits strove together with great Fury, and the Land was involved in Blood and Confusion.

Howbeit the Spirit of Fanaticism prevailed, and the King was discomfited, and taken Prisoner, and committed to the Prison of Carisbrook Castle in the Isle of Wight.

Then Charles lift up his Voice unto the Lord, saying, Judge me, O God, and plead my Cause against an ungodly Nation.

Mine Enemies have pursued and overtaken me, but do thou deliver me out of the Hand of the Wicked, out of the Hand of unrighteous cruel Men: deliver me in thy Righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine Ear unto me and save me.

Cast me not off in the Time of old Age, forsake me not when my Strength faileth.

Mine Enemies speak Evil against me, and they that lay wait for my Soul take counsel together, saying, God hat forsaken him, let us persecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him.

But let them be confounded and consumed that are Adversaries to my Soul, let them be covered with Reproach and Dishonour that seek my Hurt.

[ 50 ]

Howbeit the Prayer of Charles availed not, he was delivered up into the Hands of his Enemies; and they erected a new Court of Justice for the Trial of the King, and they brought an Accusation against him, saying,

He hat endeavoured to destroy the Rights and Liberties of the People, and to rule with an unlimited and tyrannical Power; for whic End he hath levied War against the Parliament of England and the People thereof, and hath been the Cause of all the Blood which hath been shed in the Land.

Now Charles denied the Jurisdiction of this Court, and demanded to know by what Authority he was brought before them, or by what Law of England he could be tried. But they answered him not a Word.

Howbeit a solemn Fast was appointed to seek the Lord, and beg his Direction in the Murder of the King.

Moreover an inspired Virgin was brought out of Hertfordshire, who pretended a Revelation from Heaven to encourage the Saints in their pious Work.

So they proceeded to this Trial, and condemned him as a Tyrant, Traitor, Murderer, and a publick Enemy to the Commonwealth of England, to be put to Death by severing his Head from his Body.

Moreover during the Time of his Trial, the Head of his Cane fell off, and no Man knew why; wherefore it was thought the Cane prophesied of what should come to pass.

And they treated him with great Insolence, spitting upon him, and puffing Tobacco in his Face, which they knew was hateful unto him.

[ 51 ]

Howbeit he bore with Patience their Insults, neither opened he his Libs against them.

And on the thirtieth Day of the first Month, which is called January, a Scaffold was built before the Gates of his own Palace, and he was brought thereon, and his Head was cut off and showed unto the People. And some rejoiced, but many suppressed the Groans which they durst not utter.

The Commonwealth.

And it came to pass after the Death of King Charles, that the Commons passed an Act for annulling the House of Lords, and abolishing the Regal Power as useless, burthensome and dangerous; and the Government of England was changed into a Commonwealth.

And the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, the Lord Capel, and many others who had been of the King's Party, were put to Death.

Moreover it was enacted, that all who possessed any publich Post, should take out fresh Grants and new Oaths to qualify themselves for holding the same.

This grand Alteration in the Government occasioned also many others: The Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy were abolished: Justice was no longer

[ 52 ]
administered in the King's Name, but in the Names of the Keepers of the Liberties of England: A new Council of State, consisting of thirty nine Persons, was chosen for the Administration of publick Affairs under the Parliament: new Money was coined: and a new Great Seal was made, on one side of which was seen the Parliament sitting, with this Inscription, The Great Seal of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England; on the other Side, the Arms of England and Ireland, with these Words, The first Year of Freedom by God's Blessing restored. And this Seal was committed to a certain number of Persons, who were stiled Keepers of the Liberties of Great Britain.

Many also were the Changes that were made in Religion; Episcopacy was abolished, the Common Prayer despised, Canting and Hypocrisy, and doing all kinds of Wickendess in the Name of the Lord, were the Signs of Grace; and every one worshiped God after the Foolishness of his own Heart.

Howbeit the Son of King Charles, who had fled beyond the Seas, was invited into Scotland, where he was proclaimed King; and he raised an Army of Eighteen thousand Men; and marched into England, to the City of Worcester, and encambed there.

And Cromwell, with an Army of Thirty thousand Men, pursued him to the Gates of the City, and gave him Battle; and the Army of the King was discomfited, and he was forced to fly from the Presence of Cromwell, and many were slain by the Edge of the Sword.

Nevertheless he fell not into the Hands of his Enemies, neither was he taken in their Snares: He was beset with Dangers round about, but the Hand of the Lord conducted him in Safety.

[ 53 ]

And it came to pass that he was pursued into the middle of a Wood called Boscobel, and he got up into a Tree and concealed himself, that his Pursuers passed by and saw him not.

And the Tree is called the Royal Oak unto this Day.

In a Barn also he hid himself, two Days and two Nights concealed he himself from the Rage of his Enemies; Straw only was his Bed, and he was fed by the Hand of a poor Woman with Buttermilk and Bread.

Moreover he stripped off his Royal Robes, and disguised himself in poor Array; his Hands also and his Face he dyed with Walnuts; a Hempen Shirt was next his Skin, and his outward Garment was a Leathern Doublet: In the Night also he fled, in the Darkness of the Night he escaped.

And he walked from the Going-down of the Sun even till the Morning Star appeared, insomuch that his Feed were galled with Blood.

Many other Disguises put he on, and many other Perils did he encounter; now on a Miller's Horse with dusty Bags, and now before a Country Dame on Horseback; till at last arriving at the Sea-side, he escaped to France in a small Vessel belonging to a poor Fisherman.

Mean time the Power of Cromwell increased, and his Glory grew unto the Height; insomuch that he set himself at the Head of the Commonwealth and was called the Protector thereof.

[ 54 ]

OLIVER CROMWELL Protector.

NOW Cromwell was a valiant Man, but a great Hypocrite; and he humoured the Times, pretending to Piety, and to consult the Lord in all his Doings.

Howbeit his Character is doubtful, whether he was a righteous Man or a Rogue; neither is it determined by which Apellation to call him unto this Day: Peradventure he was a Mixture of both.

Those who speak Evil of him say, that he set up himself as an Idol, and made the very Streets of London like unto the Valley of Hinnom, by burning the Bowels of Men as a Sacrifice to his Molochship: that his Pretence was Freedom for all Men, and that by the Help of that Pretence he made all Men his Slaves, setting up himself above all that ever were called Sovereign in England: that he summoned Parliaments with a Word of his Pen, and dispersed them again with the Breath of his Mouth: that he took Arms against Taxes of scarce Two hundred thousand Pounds a Year, and rasied them himself to above Two Millions: that under the pretence of reforming Religion, he robbed it even to the Skin, and then exposed it naked to the Rage of all Sects and Heresies: that he fought against the King under a Commission for him, and then took him forcibly out of the Hands of those for whom he had conquered him, and butchered him in the open Face of all the whole World, with as little Shame as Conscience or Humanity.

Thus he is made a Monster of Baseness, Ingratitude, Hypocrisy, Rebellion and Usurpation.

[ 55 ]

Howbeit there are others who defend him; saying, He was an illustrious Warriour, a great Politician, a Man of the most consummate Prudence, and who had the Art of making himself both feared and respected: that if his Government be compared with those of the two last Kings, there will appear a very great Disparity with regard to the Glory and Reputation of the English Nation: that he made himself equally dreaded by France and Spain, and the United Provinces, who all courted his Friendship with such Ardour, that they may be said to have cringed to him beyond what was becoming: that if his Ambition led him to aggrandize himself, it also led him to advance the Glory of the English Name, and the Terror of their Arms even to the Pitch of Roman Greatness: that as to his Morals, he was guilty of a few of the Vices to which Men are commonly addicted; Gluttony, Drunkenness, Gaming, Luxury and Avarice, were Crimes with which he was never reproached: and as to his Religion, his Principle was, to leave every Man at liberty, and to persecute no one on that Account: In fine, that by his great Capacity and uncommon Abilities he raised himself to the supreme Dignity, supported himself in it with great Glory, and, dying in Peace, bequeathed it to his Posterity.

And now behold, he that was a Monster is become an Hero! Wherefore, gentle Reader, out of the two Characters here given, thou mayest form such a one as seemeth best in thine Eyes, and call him Oliver Cromwell.

Now the rest of the Acts of this Ruler, and the suprising Things that he did, behold they are written in the Books of the Chronicles of the Kings of England.

[ 56 ]

And Cromwell slept with his Fathers, and was buried in the Chapel of Henry the Seventh, and Richard his Son was Protector in his stead.

RICHARD CROMWELL Protector.

AND it came to pass that the Man Richard was presently found to be incapable of the Reins of Government; he had neither Capacity to manage, Judgment to guide, nor Resolution to hold them; wherefore the Parliament took from him the Protectorship, and deposed him from the Government.

And now the Commonwealth was left to drive at random, the Government being sometimes administered by a Council of Officers, and sometimes by a Thing called a Committee of Safety, and great Confusion ensued in the Land.

And there dwelt a Man in the Norhtern Part of the Island, which is called Scotland, whose Name was Monk: moreover he was the Governor thereof, and a great Warriour.

Now this Man, taking Advantage of the publick Distractions, assembled an Army and marched to London, declariong for a Restoration of the King.

And the People were terrified at his Presence, or peradventure they were weary with perpetual Changes and Commotions; wherefore they agreed to his Proposals, and sent Messengers unto the King, who was now in Holland, desiring his Return.

And it came to pass in the twenty ninth Day of the fifth Month, which is called May, that the King was conducted in great State to his Palace at Whitehall, and all the People shouted, saying, Long live the King.

[ 57 ]

XXVI. CHARLES II.

NOW as many enormous Crimes had been committed by Men of all Degrees, insomuch that it was apprehended great Numbers, nothinking themselves safe, would depart ouf of the Land; the first Thing that the King set himself to do was to publish an Act of Indemnity.

Howbeit, he excepted out of it forty and nine Persons, who had been principally concerned in the Murder of his Father. Nevertheless only ten of them were executed.

And the King repealed all Laws that had been made in favour of a popular Government; moreover he restored the ancient Discipline of the Church, and replaced the Bishops in their former Dignity and Jurisdiction.

About this Time an Insurrection happened in London, set on foot by a small Remnant of Enthusiasts, not more than fifty, in order to destroy all the Monarchies of the Earth.

These mad Religionists were called Fifth Monarchy Men, who, by reading the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Revelations of St. John, had persuaded themselves that the Time of our Saviour's visible Reign on Earth was come; and therefore it was their Duty to take up Arms for King JESUS against the Power of the World, and that no Weapon formed against them should

[ 58 ]

prosper, but that one should chace a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight.

In Confidence of this Prophecy being fulfilled, they declared that they would rise up against the Carnal, and possess the Gate of the World; that they would never sheath the Sword till Babylon (as they called Monarchy) should become a Hissing and a Curse, and there were left neither Remnant, Son, nor Nephew: And that when they had led Captivity Captive in England, they would then to into France, Spain and Germany, and bind their Kings in Chains, and their Nobles in Fetters of Iron.

Howbeit these miserable Men were deluded, being cut off in the City by the Edge of the Swords, even by the Train-bands of the City were they destroyed.

Now it came to pass that Charles gave a loose to his Appetites, and indulged himself in all manner of Delights; and he sent forth his Pimps and his Nobles throughout all the Land, to search for the most beautiful Women that could be found.

And they ministered unto the King according to his Wishes: One brought him Eyes that melted with a dying Softness, another Lips that seemed to say come kiss me; this brought him snowy Breasts whose heaving Softness swelled with Love, and that a Shape whose wanton Motions seemed to promise Bliss luxuriant.

Now the King was pleased therewith, and he was enamoured of them all; and put forth his Sceptre unto them, and the Land was filled with Royal Bastards.

Moreover the Nation, taking Example from the

[ 59 ]

Court, ran headlong into all manner of Licentiousness and Immorality. And having seen in the former Reign all kinds of Wickedness committed under the Mask of Piety, the least Appearnce thereof was now thought Hypocrisy.

All the Wit of the Nation was turned to the Ridicule of Religion and Morality. The Stage became a School of Debauchery; and even the Pulpit, fearing to be too grave for the Times, abounded with Wit: And whereas before, they used to seek the Lord and implore his Direction even in the most trifling Affairs, it was now deemed almost superstitous to believe in him.

Howbeit the Religion of the King, says a noble* Author, was that which is vulgarity, though unjustly, called none at all, namely Deism.

But the Anger of the Lord was kindled against the King and against the People of England, and he smote the Land with a dreadful Pestilence, insomuch that there died in one Year upwards of Sixty and seven thousand Persons: Moreover, in the following Year, a terrible Fire fell on the City of London, which in four Days consumed the greatest Part thereof.

Nevertheless these Judgments made no Impression on the Spirit of Charles, who abandoned himself to his Pleasures, and was carried away so violently by his Lusts, that his whole Time and his Treasures were spent amongst Harlots; and all Matters relating to the Government of his Kingdoms were left unto the Management of his Brother the Duke of York.

And Charles was guided by his Brother in all things,

* The Duke of Buckingham.

[ 60 ]

insomuch that the People murmured greatly. Wherefore Killigrew the Jester reported unto the Courtiers, saying, The King is very ill, and hath got a sore Nose.

Then went the Courtiers in unto the King, and condoled with him, saying, We are sorry to hear your Majesty hath got a sore Nose. Whereat the King marveled greatly, asking who told them so? And they answered and said, Killigrew told us.

Then the King sent Messengers unto Killigrew, commanding him to come before him: and when he was come, the King said unto him, Why saidest thou, Killigrew, that I had got a sore Nose? And Killigrew answered and said, I concluded it must be sore, because your Majesty hath been led so long by it.

Howbeit the King liked not the Jest; moreover he reproved his Jester very severely. And (whether it was thought that Majesty was too serious a Joke to be laughed at, least peradventure it should be made ridiculous; or that it was of too dangerous Example, as it might sometimes set the whole Nation a laughing at the King's Expence; but) from that Day no Jester hath been kept in the King's Court, only plain and solemn Fools.

Now the rest of the Acts of King Charles the Second, and his Wit, and his Gallantries, and all his Intrigues, behold thou mayest find them in the bawdy Novels unto this Day.

And Charles slept with his Fathers, after he had reigned over England from the Time of his Restoration twenty and four Years, eight Months and nine Days, and James his Brother reigned in his stead.

[ 61 ]

XXVII. JAMES II.
