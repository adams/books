The Lessons for the Day.

The First Lesson

Here beginneth the First Chapter of the Book of Preferment

I.

Now it came to pass, in the 15th Year of the Reign of George the King, in the 2nd month, on the 10th of the Month at Even, that a deep sleep came upon me, the Visions of the Night possessed my Spirit, I dreamed, and behold, Robert the Minister came in unto the King, and besought him, saying:

II.

O King, live for ever! Let thy throne be established from generation to generation! But behold now, the power which thou gavest unto thy servant is at an end, the Chippenham election is lost, and the enemies of thy servant triump over him.

III.

Wherefore, now, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thy sight, suffer thy servant to depart in peace, that my soul may bless thee.

IV.

And when he had spoken these words, he resigned unto the King his place of the First Lord of the Treasury, his Chancellorship of the Exchequer, and all his other preferments.

V.

And great fear came upon Robert, and his heart smote him, and he fled from the assembly of the people, and went up into the sanctuary, and was safe.

Second Lesson

I.

Now these are the generations of those that sought preferment.

II.

Twenty years they sought preferment, and found it not: yea, twenty years they wandered in the wilderness.

III.

Twenty years they sought them places; but they found no resting place for the sole of their foot.

IV.

And lo! It came to pass in the days of George the King, that they said amongst themselves, Go to, let us get ourselves places that it may be well with us, our wives, and our little ones.

V.

And these are the names of the men that have gotten themselves places in this their day, &c.

Lessons for Evening Service

The First Lesson is the First Chapter of the Last Book of Patriotism

I.

Now it came to pass when George the King had taken some of the Tribes of Patriots into his Councils and Palaces, and hnoured them with with great Honours, and endowed them with great Places, and P-nf-ns, he set his Heart at rest, according as he was bade; inasmuch as he was told he had now found Favour in the Sight of the People.

II.

But the Trbes of the Patriots were many; nor were the leaders of all of them satisfied at what the King had done.

III.

Now these were the Tribes of the land of England. There were the Court Tribes: Of these were the W-l-p-lites, the P-lh-mites, the W-lm-ngt-nites, the H-rr-ngt-nites, the H-rv-ites, and the Yo-gites; and all these possessed great Offices in the King's Places.

IV.

And besides these were the Tribes of the Patriots; and they were called the P-ltn-yites, the Arg-lites, the C-rt-r-tites, the B-th-r-stites, the G-rites, the F-nchites, the Pit-tes, and many more, who took on them the Name of Patriots, who possessed no Offices in the Kings Palaces.

V.

Among these was also a Tribe, whom the W-lp-lites, called the Sons of Belial, and they were the Jacobites: - Albeit there were not many left in the Land.

VI.

Now although there had been Jealousy, and Strife, and Heart-burnings among these Tribes for twenty Years in the Land, yet the King was bade to set his Heart at Rest, as he had promoted to Hnours and Office the Chiefs of some of the Patriot Tribes, in the Manner as it is written in the Book of Preferment.

VII.

Howbeit the King could not set his Heart at Rest, as he had not satisfied all the Tribes of Patriots, nor dealt with them according to their Heart's Desire: For the Arg-lites murmur'd greatly, and those called Jacobites had not their Term of Reproach done away: Wherefore they said in their HEarts, What have we been doing? These more than twenty Years Labour is even as nothing; and Robert, now called the Earl, still ruleth the Roast.

VIII.

And John the chief of the Arg-lites, was greatly in Wrath, and John was a great Man, and a mighty Wariour: His Wisdom was esteemed abundant, and his Heard cleaved to the King, though not to Robert his Servant: So that his Name was much set by.

IX.

This John, from his great Knowledge in Political Architecture, imagined to himself he could best lay a solid and sure Foundation for the Good of the King, and Welfare of the People: Wherefore he drew up a Plan of a Foundation, which extended an hundred Cubits to the East, an hundred to the West, an hundred to the North, and an hundred to the South; and he called the name thereof the Broad-Bottom.

X.

And on this Basis wwere the Hopes of all the Tribes without Distinction to be built; and it was to be called the Coalition of Parties for ever and ever.

XI.

In the mean Time, Tidings of this Broad-Bottom came to Robert the Minister, and Fear came upon him: Wherefore he went to the Palace of the King in Sackcloth; and he fell down to the Earth upon his Face, and said, O King, live for ever! Be thy Throne established from Generation to Generation. If thy Servant hath ever found Favour in his Lord's Sight, let him hear the Voice of his Servant. And George said, Arise up, an dsay on.

XIII.

Then Robert arose, and cried with a loud Voice: Albeit my Lord the King hath said he will defend his Servant against those who take Council against him; yet do the Patriots set themselves against Me, and eke against Thee the Lord's Annointed.

XIV.

John, the Arg-lite, will suddenly come before the King, to propose somewhat called a Broad-Bottom, which is to extend to the East, to the West, to the North, and to the South. Now on this strong Foundation are the Enemies of the King to build their Hopes: For on this the Sons of Belial, the Jacobites, are to come into my Lord's Favour, and have great Power. Wherefore I beseech thee not to hearken to the Voice of John the Arg-lite. Trust not, O king, the Jacobites, lest peradventure Evil come upon thee in thy latter Days. And he bowed his Head, and spake no more.
