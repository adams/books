The Lessons for the Day.

The First Lesson

Here beginneth the First Chapter of the Book of Preferment

I.

Now it came to pass, in the 15th Year of the Reign of George the King, in the 2nd month, on the 10th of the Month at Even, that a deep sleep came upon me, the Visions of the Night possessed my Spirit, I dreamed, and behold, Robert the Minister came in unto the King, and besought him, saying:

II.

O King, live for ever! Let thy throne be established from generation to generation! But behold now, the power which thou gavest unto thy servant is at an end, the Chippenham election is lost, and the enemies of thy servant triump over him.

III.

Wherefore, now, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thy sight, suffer thy servant to depart in peace, that my soul may bless thee.

IV.

And when he had spoken these words, he resigned unto the King his place of the First Lord of the Treasury, his Chancellorship of the Exchequer, and all his other preferments.

V.

And great fear came upon Robert, and his heart smote him, and he fled from the assembly of the people, and went up into the sanctuary, and was safe.

Second Lesson

I.

Now these are the generations of those that sought preferment.

II.

Twenty years they sought preferment, and found it not: yea, twenty years they wandered in the wilderness.

III.

Twenty years they sought them places; but they found no resting place for the sole of their foot.

IV.

And lo! It came to pass in the days of George the King, that they said amongst themselves, Go to, let us get ourselves places that it may be well with us, our wives, and our little ones.

V.

And these are the names of the men that have gotten themselves places in this their day, &c.

Lessons for Evening Service

The First Lesson is the First Chapter of the Last Book of Patriotism

I.

Now it came to pass when George the King had taken some of the Tribes of Patriots into his Councils and Palaces, and hnoured them with with great Honours, and endowed them with great Places, and P-nf-ns, he set his Heart at rest, according as he was bade; inasmuch as he was told he had now found Favour in the Sight of the People.

II.

But the Trbes of the Patriots were many; nor were the leaders of all of them satisfied at what the King had done.

III.

Now these were the Tribes of the land of England. There were the Court Tribes: Of these were the W-l-p-lites, the P-lh-mites, the W-lm-ngt-nites, the H-rr-ngt-nites, the H-rv-ites, and the Yo-gites; and all these possessed great Offices in the King's Places.

IV.

And besides these were the Tribes of the Patriots; and they were called the P-ltn-yites, the Arg-lites, the C-rt-r-tites, the B-th-r-stites, the G-rites, the F-nchites, the Pit-tes, and many more, who took on them the Name of Patriots, who possessed no Offices in the Kings Palaces.

V.

Among these was also a Tribe, whom the W-lp-lites, called the Sons of Belial, and they were the Jacobites: - Albeit there were not many left in the Land.

VI.

Now although there had been Jealousy, and Strife, and Heart-burnings among these Tribes for twenty Years in the Land, yet the King was bade to set his Heart at Rest, as he had promoted to Hnours and Office the Chiefs of some of the Patriot Tribes, in the Manner as it is written in the Book of Preferment.

VII.

Howbeit the King could not set his Heart at Rest, as he had not satisfied all the Tribes of Patriots, nor dealt with them according to their Heart's Desire: For the Arg-lites murmur'd greatly, and those called Jacobites had not their Term of Reproach done away: Wherefore they said in their HEarts, What have we been doing? These more than twenty Years Labour is even as nothing; and Robert, now called the Earl, still ruleth the Roast.

VIII.

And John the chief of the Arg-lites, was greatly in Wrath, and John was a great Man, and a mighty Wariour: His Wisdom was esteemed abundant, and his Heard cleaved to the King, though not to Robert his Servant: So that his Name was much set by.

IX.

This John, from his great Knowledge in Political Architecture, imagined to himself he could best lay a solid and sure Foundation for the Good of the King, and Welfare of the People: Wherefore he drew up a Plan of a Foundation, which extended an hundred Cubits to the East, an hundred to the West, an hundred to the North, and an hundred to the South; and he called the name thereof the Broad-Bottom.

X.

And on this Basis wwere the Hopes of all the Tribes without Distinction to be built; and it was to be called the Coalition of Parties for ever and ever.

XI.

In the mean Time, Tidings of this Broad-Bottom came to Robert the Minister, and Fear came upon him: Wherefore he went to the Palace of the King in Sackcloth; and he fell down to the Earth upon his Face, and said, O King, live for ever! Be thy Throne established from Generation to Generation. If thy Servant hath ever found Favour in his Lord's Sight, let him hear the Voice of his Servant. And George said, Arise up, and say on.

XIII.

Then Robert arose, and cried with a loud Voice: Albeit my Lord the King hath said he will defend his Servant against those who take Council against him; yet do the Patriots set themselves against Me, and eke against Thee the Lord's Annointed.

XIV.

John, the Arg-lite, will suddenly come before the King, to propose somewhat called a Broad-Bottom, which is to extend to the East, to the West, to the North, and to the South. Now on this strong Foundation are the Enemies of the King to build their Hopes: For on this the Sons of Belial, the Jacobites, are to come into my Lord's Favour, and have great Power. Wherefore I beseech thee not to hearken to the Voice of John the Arg-lite. Trust not, O king, the Jacobites, lest peradventure Evil come upon thee in thy latter Days. And he bowed his Head, and spake no more.

XV.

At the Name of Jacobites the ---, as if he were bewitched by the Spell of a Wizzard, fell into great Wrath, and rent his Hat from his Head, and smote it, and sprun'd it with his Feet in furious-wise; ans swore none of that Tribe should have Power under him, to the End that they might not have Power over him.

XVI.

And Robert laughed in his Sleeve, --- as much as to say, Tush, go to: I care not for what man can do unto me. And his Heart was puffed up exceedingly; and he departed from the Palace with great Glee.

XVII.

Now it came to pass, in a few Days after John the Arg-lite had been apointed Captain over ten thousands, and twenty thousands, and forty thousands, he went to the Palace of the King, and they communed together, and the Broad-bottom was mentioned.

XVIII.

And as soon as the Words were uttered, the --- fell into a great Rage, and cried aloud, Jacobites! Jacobites! Traytors! Traytors! Then he was deaf to all the Captan of War could say; and he turned his A- on the Captain of his Armies, and the Captain of his Armies turned his A- on him, and said, he would be no more the Captain of his Armies; And so they departed in great Dudgeon.

XIX.

During these Things there was a Report among the People, that there was a League and a Covenant between some of the Chiefs of the Tribes of the Court, and some of the Chiefs of the Tribes of the Country; and that in defence of Robert, a mighty SCREEN should be made near the Throne of the ---; and that he should retire behind that SCREEN, as to a Sanctuary, and be as safe there, even as if he touched the Horns of the Altar.

XX.

There was indeed Communion among the Chiefs, and it was agreed, that from that Day for ever, the W-lp-lites, should be no longer called W-lp-lites, but Orf-dites; and that the Pul-ites should be no longer called Pul-ites, but B-thites: And they are so called unto this day.

XXI.

Moreover, that this should be as a Peace-Offering; and, for Time to come, the O-f-d-ites, the B-thites, the C-rt-r-tites, the P-lh-mites, the B-th-stites, the W-lm-ngtonites, the G-r-ites, the Pit-ites, the H-rr-ngtonites, and all the Tribes of ites, should be as one Tribe, save only the Arg-lites, and those People called by Robert the Sons of Belial, the Jacobites.

XXII.

Accordingly all these Things came to pass: And Robert was made a Prince of the Land, and called O-f-d; and William was made a Prince of the Land, and called B-th. So also fared it with the other Chiefs, as had been agreed among them; and the Patriots became as Courtiers, and those in Disgrace were numbered among the Rulers of the People. And the Courtiers who went In had Compassion on their Brethren who went Out, and gave P-n-fi-ns to them, each Man according to his Family and Tribe.

XXIII.

Now these are the Acts of the Patriots. And the People murmured greatly, saying, "What have our Chiefs done? In vain have our Patriots raged, and the People have imagined a vain Thing."

XXIV.

And O-f-d the E-l laughed to Scorn the Murmurings of the People, saying, Mine Exaltation seemeth a Wonder in the Eyes of the People; but their Wonder will cease, as Wonders now do, on the Even of the ninth Day. This is a happy Day, and I will rejoice and be glad in it.

XXV.

Then his Coaches, and Chariots, and Horsemen, and Followers were got ready, and they went to Ch-ls-a to be merry; where he sung this Song in praise of the King, who had delivered him from his Enemies.

To the Chief Musician on the Organ, RALPH COURTEVILLE.

A SONG of O-F-D's

God prosper long our noble King,
Who heard my woeful Call;
To him with merry Heart I'll sing,
Who sav'd my dreadful Fall.

Both Death and Hell encompass'd me,
And Terrors round arose:
But then I cry'd full piteously,
O! Screen me from my Foes.

He heard, he spake; his Royal Will
Full Royally was shewn:
Pr-r-g-tive shall screen thee still
Behind my Royal Throne.

What then, tho' all the People say,
That this is all a Farce;
Still shall my merry Heart be gay,
And bid them kiss my ---

So ends the First Chapter of the Last Book of PATRIOTISM.

The SECOND LESSON is the First Epistle of CH-ST-RF--LD to the KENSINGTONIANS.

I.

CH-ST-RF--LD, called to be a Patriot of his Country, thro' the Spirit of Liberty, and Love to his Country,

II.

Unto the late Brethren called Patriots, now at the Royal Palase at K-nsi-gt-n; to all Britons in general, who love Freedom, Virtue, and Justice, with all that in every Place detest Venality, Corruption, and Dependancy:

III.

Grace be unto you, to be true and faithful to your Country.

IV.

Now I beseech you Brethren, take heed concerning the Things which I write: For even among the best of ye I have been assured, there has been Luke-warmness, Indolence, private Views, and in some a thorough falling off.

V.

It hath also been declared unto me of ye, my Brethren, by those who are of the House of Ch-rlt-n, that ye are Time-servers, Deceivers, and Word-Breakers.

VI.

that also there are Divisions and Contentions among the younger Brethren, who have but lately had a Call to the Ministry: The one faith, I am of O-f--d, and another, I am of B-th; others, I am of C-rt-t, I am of S-dys, and I of Ar-gle.

VII.

Now, who is O-f-d? He was once a Patriot, and suffered for Liberty's Sake. Twenty Years and upwards hath he since been a Prime M-r; and what hath he done for Liberty? His Patriotism became Corruption, an dhis Professions of a Love for Liberty were changed to Endeavors to corrupt his Country,

VIII.

Who is B-th? --- The Friend of O-f-d, --- and was, but the other Day, the professed one of his Country. --- What hath he done for his Country? Hath he brought her Enemies to Justice? Hath he broken the Bands of Corruption? Hath he kept his Word with Fr-d-ck the Pr-ce? What then hath he done to be called Patriotism?

IX.

He hath changed his Name; and with his Name his avowed Principles, the Love of his Countrymen for the Smile of his K--.

X.

Who are C-rt-t and S-dys? They were Patriots; --- they are now Courtiers of the K-g; and peradventure, the are become like the K-g's old Courtiers.

XI.

Verily, verily, I say unto you, unless a Man hath a stedfast Faith that the Love of Liverty, and of our Country, is to be preferred before Honours, Titles, Promotions, Places and such like; he is in much Danger to have his Patriotism staggered in King's Palaces.

XII.

P-l-y was, but is not. --- Touching Place-Bills, S-dys uttereth not his Voice: He is neither for displacing nor displeasing: There is no Poison of Asps under his Lips: He speaketh not: His Heart pondereth on Ways and Means.

XIII.

Now, I beseech you, Men of Britain, and Brethren, in the Love of Freedom, if any of you would be called Patriots, should you perceive Men in any wise speak or act contrary to the Doctrine they themselves have taught you, contemn them as false Brethren.

XIV.

For they are such as serve not their Country for the public Wealth, but for their own private Lucre; and, by their good Words and fair Speeches, deceive the Hearts of the Simple.

XV.

It has been said among the m-n-st-rs of State, what! Is there not Patriotism in a Court? Are all R-gues that enter into it?

XVI.

I say not so: God forbid: But a Minister of State must, to be a Patriot, be a Friend to his Country: he must not only be just himself, but endeavour to bring to Justice whoever hath been unjust; and let Men so account of him, as of the servant of the King, and Friend and Steward to the People.

XVII.

Moreover it is required in Stewardship, that a Man rack not the Tenants over much; that he spendeth not immense Wealth to Beggar them into Slavery; for what Field will always bear large Crops of Corn, without it somtimes lieth Fallow?

XVIII.

How long have we seen the Iniquities of False Stewardship? How long have we groan'd under Affliction? How long have Bribery and Corruption kiss'd one another? How long have Peculation and Oppression gone Hand in Hand?

XIX.

O ye Men of Palaces, hearken unto me. O ye Ministers of State! give Ear unto the Words of my Mouth.

XX.

Woe unto them who are given to change! Woe unto them who will not decree Righteous Decrees! who will not follow the Righteousness they have prescribed!

XXI.

For a Day of Visitation shall come: And what, O ye false Patriots! will ye do in the Day of Visitation? To whom will ye flee for Help? Where will you flee for Succour? Where will you leave your Glory?

XXII.

Tho' ye spake with the Tongues of Men and of Angels, and have not true Patriotism, a true Love for your Country, ye ar all ass sounding Brass, and tinkling Cymbals.

XXIII.

And tho' ye have the Gifts of Treasuryships, of Secretaryships, and have Knowledge, ant tho' ye have all faith that ye cou'd remove Mountains, and have so little Patriotism as to remove them not, ye are as nothing.

XXIV.

Tho' ye have spoken Speeches, tho' ye have made Protests, tho' ye have cry'd out against an all grasping and oppressive Minister, and have not Patriotism to bring him to Condemnation, it profiteth nothing.

XXV.

Patriotism is vigilant and persevering: Patriotism changeth not: Patriotism vaunteth not itself, nor is puffed up by Places or by Honours:

XXVI.

Doth not from uncorruptible become corruptible; and seeketh not for private Lucre; thinketh not of enlarging Prerogative;

XXVII.

Rejoiceth not in new Taxations, but rejoiceth in reducing the National Debt: and for this End

XXVIII.

Striveth at all things; from the K--- beareth all things; hopeth all things; and produceth all things.

XXIX.

Patriotism never faileth: But whether there be great Abilities they shall fail; whether there be Eloquence of tongue, that shall cease; whether there be Knowledge, that shall vanish away; but Patriotism, the Truth of Heart, abideth forever.

XXX.

And now abideth great Eloquence, great Knowledge, and great Patriotism; these three: But the greatest of these is Patriotism.

So endeth the Epistle of the CH-ST-R-F-D of the KENSINGTONIANS.
