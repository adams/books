The Fall of Samuel the Squomicutite, and the Overthrow of the Sons of Gideon.

NOW Solomon the Son Solomon slept with his Fathers, and was buried in the Tomb of Solomon his Father, and Solomon his Son reigned in his Stead.

In those days there was Contention in the Land of the Pumkinites, between Stephen the Chuckwettonite/Choppomiskite, and Samuel the Squomicutite. And the inhabitants of Tropwen sent message to Samuel the Squomicutite, saying : We will give our Daughters unto thy Sons, and take thy Sons for our Daughters, we will become as one People, and fight thy Battle against Stephen the Choppomiskite, if thou wilt come and dwell in the land of Tropwen.

And Samuel being a weak Man, hearkened unto the People of Tropwen, and came and dwelt among them, at different times, for the Space of three whole Weeks.

And Samuel made Affinity with Gideon and his Sons.--Now the Sons of Ci[dom?] are [Th?]under[bass?], Nimsbi, Testy, and [Sil?]bern, all mighty Men of Valor--And [?] said unto the Sons of Gideon, if you will hear my Voice, and hearken unto my Words, ye shall be great Men in the Land.

Blunder[bass?] shall ride on a large greay Mare, with a Sword by his Side, and a white Wa[?] his Hand, and shall execute Judgment in the Land.

Nimsbi [shall?] be first Ruler in Tropwen, with a Staff made of Hickory [Wood?] shall [?] and down in the Streets of Tropwen, before the People. [?] I give my Commission, to over[?] the Merchant and T[?] their Ships shall not go forth or come again unless they [?]

[?] younger Brother, ye shall send forth with my M[?] ... Time, I will exale(?) him, and make him a [?] Tropwen.

[?] Gideon, loving the Mammon of Unrighteousness, ha[?] ... of Samuel, and they all arose furiously on the Morrow.

And they ran unto the Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water [...] that use the Spade and Pickaxe, saying, Samuel the Squomicutite [...] War against Stephen the Chuckwittite; and if ye assist not Samuel, we will [?] ye from our Dwellings and withold Food and Raiment from your Children that they [...].

And thus [...] Sons of Gideon, ride on Horses and in Chariots, to and fro, [up?] and down, [the?] Streets of Tropwen, exclaiming against Stephen, and oppressing(?) the inhabitants of Tropwen, for the Space of three whole Months.

Samuel made a [?] League with the Buyers and Sellers, and Money-changers, and if they would [?] Stephen Root and Branch, he would give unto them the possessions of the P[?] throughout all the Land of the Pumkinites, from the Land of the Fishermen eastward until thou comest to the River Paukituck Westward.

And the Battle went sore against the Sons of Gideon, several of them were slain, and those that remain, were sore affrighted so that they look like [...] besmeared with Ashes [?] frosty Morning.

Now the Acts of the Government of Samuel, are [?] recorded in the Book of Samuel, nor in the Acts of the Kings, for he said much but did NOTHING.
