Eran Shalev:
  Georgians were "the Children of the land of George," Virginians were "the children of the land of the Virgin," and so forth. Even the most recognizable slogan of the Revolution, "no taxation without representation" was rephrased in biblical fashion: Americans demanded "that they should have their own Sanhedrim [the ancient council of seventy Jewish elders], in which they should be taxed."
