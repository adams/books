Now it came to pass in the days of Louis, that there reigned a Queen in the land of Hungary, one of the daughters of Charles, a very fair, and beautiful woman ; and behold, all the people loved her exceedingly, and she waxed strong.

And Louis was displeased, and his wrath was kindled against her ; so that he sware unto the Lord, that she should be spoiled of her inheritance, even of the heritage that Charles her father had given unto her.

And he put up a Prince against her, whose name also was Charles, and espoused his cause, saying, Behold the land, it is a good one ; and I will surely put it into thine hands : yea, even into thine hands will I put it, that thou shalt rule over it.

And the thing seemed good unto Charles ; for he wist not what was lurking in the heart of Louis.

And they gathered together a mightyhost, and sent against her, saying, Now will we cut off this woman from the face of the earth. And the people were sore afraid, even the people over all Hungary.

And they cried unto the Lord their God in their distress, and the Lord heard their cry.

And behold, there was a sore battle fought : but the men of Hungary prevailed : for the Lord was on their side.

Nevertheless, Louis sent unto them another host, which made them greater than the former ; and he said unto his counsellors, Behold, we have sent a mighty army, so that she must fall.

And Fleury the high-priest stood up, and said, O King, live for ever !

There is not a King upon the earth, that can be compared unto thee ; for thou sayest in thine heart, I will have this Kingdom for my servant Charles ; and I will bring down the power of the Dutch, and the power of the English will I also bring down.

Spain is in mine hands ; and behold, I will make myself King over all the land of Germany, and then shall I be King over all the earth.

And the saying pleased the King ; and Fleury waxed great in the favour of the King, and the King made him next unto himself ; so that there was not a man in the kingdom but was governed by him, no not even the King himself.

And the terror of France became exceeding great over the whole land of Germany ; and the people were sore afraid.

Then the Princes of the people communed among themselves, saying, What shall we do, that we may not be destroyed by the French ; we, our wives, and our little ones?

Behold, we will send GEORGE, who reigneth in the land of England, that he may join his people unto our people : for they are a brave and a warlike people, and very terrible is their name unto the French.

For we have heard from our fathers of the noble works they did in their days, and in the old time before them :

How they cut down their armies, and laid them waste, and tarried not, till they had even as it were swept them out of the land.

And when these tidings came unto GEORGE the King of England, his heart was moved, and he said, Surely I will go up, and fight for these people ; even I myself will go up.

And he took unto him a small number of men, even as it were an handful ; and he went up, and fought against them.

And he spake comfortably unto his army, saying, Behold I will be at the head of you ; and in no danger shall ye go, but I will be there also.

Wherefore now, my servants, shew yourselves Englishmen, like unto your fore-fathers, that it may be well with us.

And when the men of England heard this, their hearts were knit together, even as it were the heart of one man ; and they shouted with a loud voice, and cried, God bless the King ! we will not a man depart from thee, while we have breath in our nostrils.

And the battle waxed very hot ; for the men of France had said in their hearts, We will take GEORGE the King of England for then shall we find great favour in the eyes of Louis our King.

And behold, they strove exceedingly, so that the most chosen men of the host of England failed them in their hearts, and they turned their backs.

And when GEORGE the King beheld this, he was exceeding wroth ; and he spake unto the captains of his host, saying, Turn them again, that they may not be a slander, and a by-word among mine enemies.

And behold, they turned again ; and the whole host fell upon the men of France, and discomfited them, and slew them on the plain with a very great slaughter, even down unto the river, which is called Mayn.

And there fell of the French in that day, seven thousand and fifty chosen men ; and great lamentation was made, for the men of the King of England spared them not.

Then were the hearts of the people rejoiced, and the widow and the fatherless were comforted.

And they prayed unto the Lord to bless the men of England, who had delivered them from the falling a prey into the jaws of their enemies.
