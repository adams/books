AND ic came to

many woes happened, and 
there was great murmur-

number of the Gentiles

land 

2 And the Jews fald a 
mongft themfelves; Now 
is our power gone from 
us, and her glory depart-' 
edifrom Judah. 

3 Then came thefc 
wdrds unto the ears ot 
Jfaae the judg^, and he 
U»a3 grievec? 

4 Wherefore he fcnt 
unto his counfellors, bid- 
ding them come unto him 
that he might take counfe] 
concerning thefc things; 
and they came and flood 
before him

the length of his hair was 
comely, and when he 
polled his head (bccaufe 
the hair was heavy on him, 
therefore he polled it) he 
weighed the hair of Jiis 
head, at two hundred 
Ihekels, after the king's 
weight. 

6 And Adonis ths 
fcribe was a learned man, 
after the learning of the 
Jews ; for he had read 
over the leven volums of 
the "Talmud^ containing 
the dreams and vifions 
of thofe who hated truth \ 
and from thence he learnt 
to fay ti\e things that ives 
not,

(which is by the river of. 
Grief) even yillegb in the 
mountains, and the inha- 
bitants of the inner plains. 

17 And the people 
mutter many mutterings, 
faying. The Jews are a»- 
iujl rulerSy and care not 
for the Gentiles, it Jerufa- 
Jem be fafe. We muft 
needs die ; but is not life 
as a precious ornament, 
opened to the air, which 
cannot be collefted again ? 

18 We have neither 
helmets on our heads, nor 
fpears in our hands, nor 
coats of mail, of mail for 
war ! but as a fool falleth 
before wicked mrn, fo wt 
fall. 

19 Now, therefore, that 
I fpcak of thefe things to 
my Lord the judge, it is 
becaufe the people have 
made me afraid. 

20 I am one of them 
that are peaceable and 
faithful in fudab. The

any man call me rafcal ia

2t Peace be unto uf 
and to our helpers. The 
noifc of the drum andthc 
trumpet is terrible : I love

22 This thing then fhall 
my Lord the judge do, 
and the thing will fervc

thy dream. 

14 Thou faweft, O 
JUDGE, and* behold a 
great multitude \ and the 
multitude was like unto 
the fands on the feafliore, 
or the leaves in the foreft 
of Bafan, for numbers. 

15 And fome were 
feotmen, and Ibme were 
horfemen*. and fhey en- 
compafled thee about : 
but my Lord was exalted 
and rode in an open cha- 
riot, that he might be 
feen of all the people. 

16 On the right hand 
lat Aitmii the fcribe, and 



was a llrangc tree. 

19 The tree was ftrong 
and ftraight and tall, and 
it had two trunks that 
went into the ground •, fo 
that there was no tree in 
the wildernefs like unto it. 

20 And people marvel- 
led, becaufe it had two 
trunks, that ic had no 
leaves nor fruit, for ic was 
barren. 

21 Bur, behold! the 
trunks had no roots, and 
therefore was it barren.

but, bdioldf my Lord che 
judge, and Adonis the 
fcribe, and Mafterol of 
the fuburbs, went not 
with it, but ftaid behind. 

25 For their heads 
caught hold of the tree 
and they were taken up be- 
tween heaven andeartli, 
even as Abfalom was tak- 
en up in the boughs of the 
oak, in the wood of E- 
phraim, fave thai they 
-were not taken up by the 
hair^ 

26 Thefe are the vifi- 
ons which my Lord the 
judge faw, in the night 
upon his bed. Now the 
interpretation thereof is* •

cried out fuddcnly, £- 
nough, enough, O Kirak I 
This is my dream, and the 
interpretation needeth not, 
tor in the meaning thcreolf 
a child is as an aftrologer, 
and a Ibckling child, as 
a Chaldean. 

28 So Kerak was pro- 
moted and made keeper of 
the prifon, and it was a 
great promotion : for in 
theledays if onecommun'd 



with a man that was hate- 
ful tolfaac the judge, tho' 
he were a father or a near 
friend, he was fhut up »• 
mongft the criminals and 
a dungeon became h^ 
dwelling. 

29 So he kept the peo- 
ple in fears, and fear kept 
them in filence, and.fi- 
lence kept them in flave- 
ry, and havery kept them 
in every thing unbecom- 
ing MAN, who was made 
in the image of his Crea- 
tor. 

30 Ifaac the judge was 
fore troubled with the 
dream, which he bad 
dreamed, and he went to 
his own houfe and gut 
aflies on his head, and 
mourned fixty days and 
fixty nights, and wou'd 
not be fecn of any one.
