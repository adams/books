A Fragment of the CHRONICLES of
Nathan Ben Saddi.



BOOK I. CHAP I.



AND it came to pass in the days of Isaac, judge over Judah that many woes happened, and there was great murmuring of the people; for the number of the Gentiles was encreased much in the land.

2 And the Jews said amongst themselves; Now is our power gone from us, and her glory departed from Judah.
3 Then came these words unto the ears of Isaac the judge, and he was grieved.

4 Wherefore he sent unto his counsellors, bidding them come unto him that he might take counsel concerning these things; and they came and stood before him.

5 Now there was amongst his counsellors a certain man, a scribe, called Adonis, which, being interpreted, is beautiful. For the length of his hair was comely, and when he polled his head (because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it) he weighed the hair of his head, at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight.

6 And Adonis the scribe was a learned man, after the learning of the Jews; for he had read over the seven volums of the Talmud, containing the dreams and visions of those who hated truth; and from thence he learnt to say the things that was not.

7 He likewise had perused the jargums of the law, tho' not in the original; for he understood it not; but the translations thereof, by Jacobs the translator, those he perused.

8 And whatever dropped from Jacobs the translator, that he swallowed; and

Dell-warr, Shaw-an and Cherocks; from Docan (which is by the river of Grief) even Allegh in the mountains, and the inhabitants of the inner plains.

17 And the people mutter many mutterings, saying, The Jews are unjust rulers, and care not for the Gentiles, if Jerusalem be safe. We must needs die; but is not life as a precious ornament, opened to the air, which cannot be collected again?

18 We have neither helmets on our heads, nor spears in our hands, nor coats of mail, of mail for war! but as a fool falleth before wicked men, so we fall.

19 Now, therefore, that I speak of these things to my Lord the judge, it is because the people have made me afraid.

20 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Judah. The sword is hateful to my eyes, and gun-powder stinketh in my nostrils. If any man draweth a cane cross my mouth, I lick the dirt as a serpent; and if any man call me rascal in one ear, I turn the other, and bid him say on.

21 Peace be unto us and to our helpers. The noise of the drum and the trumpet is terrible: I love no sound but MY OWN.

22 This thing then shall my Lord the judge do, and the thing will serve us well; and the complaints of the people shall be turn'd into praises, and their revilings into thanksgivings.

23 Let us send out false prophets among the people, to every city and to every village, and to each part of the country, divers; and let them cry aloud with a great voice, saying,

24 Arise, arise, O ye people! be watchful and spare not; for the man that ruleth over you is a man of a wicked heart, and seeketh to make you eaters of grass and drinkers of water.

25 He longeth to yoke you unto his chariot, and to drive you with the burthends as one driveth mules.

26 He hateth your counsellors, because they watch over you as faithful dogs watch over sheep, and will not suffer you to be devoured of the beast.

27 Arise, arise then, O ye people! and strengthen the hands of your counsellors. Let the Philistines ravage in the borders, it is better to die than to live, and NOT DO AS WE PLEASE.

28 And it shall come to pass, when these words shall be heard of the people, that they will be wroth against their ruler, and they say; This man is the cause of our evils; cast him out from among us.

29 For the people will speak in simplicity, and will not know the thing.

30 And it shall not be said any more that the Jews are unjust rulers; nor shall be remembered in the land that war is an abomination unto them.

31 But the crime shall lie upon the head of the wicked ruler, even upon his head shall the innocent blood lie; but from my Lord the judge, and from his seed, and from his HOUSE, shall it be taken quite away.

32 And when the people shall send up their counsellors to Jerusalem, thus shall it happen: There will be none that can turn to the right or to the left, from ought that my Lord shall speak.

33 And my Lord shall observe all the rites and ceremonies of the Jews which he hath long neglected, and shall go into the temple, and pray in publick, after the manner of the Pharisees; and the people will take notice of it, and be pleased.

34 Then shall my Lord counsel a tribute to be raised over all Judah, and it shall be so: for the counsels which my Lord counselleth in these days shall be as tho' a man had enquired at an Oracle.

35 And it will be said, my Lord careth for the people; but my Lord will hold the bag, and bear what is put therein, as did some rulers in the days of Old.

36 And when the tribute shall be raised, then shall my Lord set one counsellor over a post, and another over an office; so the men shall be pleased, and cleave unto thee, and give thee a GREAT NAME.

37 Let my Lord the judge do according to these sayings, and his authority shall be established in his House, and his HOUSE, will govern the people.

38 And the saying of Adonis the scribe pleased Isaac the judge well; and he turn'd unto Daniel the Æthiopian, and said unto him, What sayset thou? shall it be done after the sayings of Adonis the scribe?

39 And Daniel the Æthiopian opened his mouth, and said, YEA: for Daniel was not eloquent, but of a slow tongue.

25 For their heads
caught hold of the tree
and they were taken up be-
tween heaven andeartli,
even as Abfalom was tak-
en up in the boughs of the
oak, in the wood of E-

26 Thefe are the vifi-
