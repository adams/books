J[Il, advantag:rs w;i;C:i lac ■■: 1 of thii 

work into our seminaries ol" educaii^ . ; be likely 

to produce are many and obvious : 

1. The autl'ior having adopted for the model of his 
?tYly the phraseology of the best of !)joks, remarkable 
fo Its simplicity and strena:lfi, the young pupil will ac- 
quire, with the knowledge of reading, a love for the 
minner in w'licli the great truths of Divine Revelation 
are convoyed to his understanding, and this will be .111 
iiiaucemtnt to him to stndy the Holy Scriptures. 

2 All the circumstances related in this work are 
true; they are recent, being within the recollection 
of the present generation ; they form a very import^irit 
part in tlie history of our country, and will be read 
with pride and pleasure by ev^jy one of ouryoangmeH 
in whose bosom ri^ay glow the sentiments of patriotism 
and piety. 

3. The most prominent virtues of the lieroes who 
produced the events here treated of, are held up in 
such a manner as to inspire in the youthful mind a 
love for the coujitry they defended, ana a spirit of 
h :nr)"ab!c r rdalioi), ^vhich may be higlily advanta- 

■;^ to th -t counrry whenever it shall be necessary to 
c:i]l it into exercise. 

4. Although a vein of morality ru.is i'.rono-h the 
work, the sentiments have not the smnhest ijearin^y qh 
tlie particular teiiets of any religious seer, bui are cal- 
culated to be read by all persons, of wiiatever d^monii- 
nation, who love virtue, valor, and treedom,' 

5. The fa-ts described are related in so clear and 
concise a- way as without much eifbrtfon the part of 

.the pupil, will easily fasten themselves on his memory. 

These are some amongst other reasons wliich have

G. J. HUNT. 

Ncw-YorJ:, June V3, 1817. 
Sir, 

I had noticed your work on the late war long 
before I had the pleasure of 3'our acqisiJjit'uice. ii 
seems to be a plain and popular mode of txiiibiting the 
nansactions of which it treats. 

One of the defects in the lUeiature of our country 
ll.at of good historians. That class of our citizeiss 
vi.lch is called to act, shows itn paralleled atchievenient 
and euteriii Jze. The other sections, to whom is ailot- 
xv(\ the busiritis ol narrating and recerding events, are 
;:ot so far advanceii. ihe reason is evident 5 there must 
be deeds to describe and perpetuate, bef.-c there can be 
historians. In process ol lime, writers duly qualified, 
will maKe thi^ir appearance. 

Your Chronicle of events deserves to be mentioned 
in the list of useful publications. It will answer as a 
dorn! lent of constant and ready reference. The re- 
:!io!i of it into schools, will rendei Jamiiiar to chil- 
i . 1 the chief actions iii the contest, and teaci them, at 
5'^'^ .' :ne time, to respect their country and its institu- 
tions.

t OW it came to pass, in tlie one thousand eight 
hundred and twelfth year of the christian era, and itt 
tJie thirty and sixth year after the people of the pro- 
vinces of Columbia had declared themselves a free and 
independent nation ; 

1 That in the sixth month of the same year, on the 
first da}'- of the month, the chief Governor, whom the 
people had chosen to rule over the land of Colujubia; 

S Even James, whose sir-name was IVlADisoiS, de- 
livered a written paper* to the Great SANHEDiiiMt of 
the people, who w€re assembled together. 

4 And the name of the city where tV people were 
gathered together was called after the name- oi the chief 
criptain of the land of Columbia, .wliose fame extendeth 
to the uttermost parts of the earth ; albeit, he had slept 
whh his fathers.

INGTC'7. 

rsov7., when tliC written paper was received, the 
doors of the chambers of the Great Sanhedrim were 
closed, and a seal \A-as put upon every man's mouth. 

7 And the counsellors of the nation, and the wise men 
thereof, ordered the written paper which James hj^d de- 
livered unto them to be read aloud ; and the interpreta- 
tion thereof was in this wise : 

8 Lo ! the lords and the princes of the kingdom of 
Bntaifl, in the fulness oftlieir pride and power, have 
trampled upon the altar of Liberty, and violated the 
sanctuary thereof : 

9 Inasmuch as they hearkened not unto the voice of 
moderation, when th.e cry of the people of Columbia 
was, Peace ! peace ! 

10 Inasmuch as tliey permitted not the tail ships of 
Columbia to sail in peace on the waters of the mighty 
deep 5 saving in their hearts, Of these will we make 
f;pc^il, and ihey shall be given unto the king. 

n Inasmuch as they robbed the ships of Columbia 
of the strong men that wrought therein, and took them 
for their own use, even as a man taketh his ox or his 

ass. . , 

12 Inasmuch a? they kept the men stolen from the 
ships of Colmnbia in bondage many years, and caused 
Ihem to fight the battles of the king, even agamst their 
own brethren! neither gave they unto them snver or 
cold, but rnn^r- stripes.

14 Moreover, the Council of Britain sent forth a De^ . 
.r.e to all tlie nations of the earth, sealed with thesign^ 
CI the Friuce Regent, who governed the nation in tne 
name of the king his father ; for lo ! the king was pos- 
sessed of an evil spirit, and his son reigned in his stead. 

15 Now this Decree of the Council of Britam was 
a grievous thing, inasmuch as it permitted not those who 
dialt in merchandize to go whithersoever they chose, and 
to trade freely with all parts of the earth. 

16 And it fell hard upon the people of Columbia; 
for the king said unto them, Ye shall come with your 
vessels unto me and pay tribute, then may ye depart to 
another country. 

17 Now these things pleased the pirates and the 
cruisers of Britain mightily, because it permitted them to 
rob the commerce of Columbia with impunity.

wrongs committed against them be increased tenfold, and 
they shall be as a mock and a bye-word among all nations. 

10 Moreover, the righteousness of your cause shall 
lead you to glory, and the pillars of your liberty shall 
norbe shaken. 

11 Therefore, say we unto you. Gird on your swords 
and go forth to battle against the king ; even against the 
strong powers of Britain j and the Lord God of Hosts 
be with you, 

12 Now when the great Sanhedrim of the people 
heard those things which the wise men had uttered, they 
pondered them in their minds many days, and weighed 
them well ; 

13 Even until the seventeenth day of the month pon- 
dered they in secret concerning tlie matter. 

14 And it was so, that on the next day they sent forth 
a Decree, making WAR upon the kingdom of Great 
Britain, and upon the servants, and upon the slaves 
thereof. 

15 And the Decree was signed with the hand writing 
©f James, the chief Governor of the land of Columbia. 

16 After these things, the doors of the chambers o^ 
iKJ Sanhedrim were opened.

Hcception of the Declaration of War in Great Britain 
— her friends in America — Caleb Strong — Hartford 
Convention. 



A, 



-ND it came to pass, that when the prhices and the 
lords and the counsellors of Britain saw the Decree, 
their wrath was kindled, and their hearts were ready to 
burst with indignation. 

2 For, verily, said they, this insult hath overflowed 
the cup of our patience ; and now will we chastise the 
impudence of these Yankees, and "the people of Colum- 
bia shall bow be lore the king. 

3 Then will we rule them with a rod of iron ; and they 
shall be, unto us, hewers of wood and drawers of water. 

4 For, verily, shall we suffer these cunning Yankees 
to beard the mi^^hty lion, with half a dozen fir-built 
frigates, the men whereof are but mercenary cowards — 
<* bastards and outlaws ?" 

5 Neither durst they array themselves in battle against 
tlie men of 13ritain. No ! we will sVvTep them from th<^ 
face of the waters, and their name shall be heard no 
more among nations. 

6 Shall the proud conquerors of Europe not laugh to 
scorn the feeble efforts of a iaw unorganized soldiers, un- 
disciplined, and fresh from the plough, the hce, and the 
mattock? 

7 Y^ea, they shall surely fall ; for they were not bre<3r 
to fighting as were the servants, of the king.

8 Their large cities, their to\vnSj and their villages 
■S^'ill we burn with consuming fire. 

9 Their oil, and their wheat, and their rye, and tlieh' 
€orn, and their barley, and their rice, and tlielr buck- 
wheat, and their oats, and their flax, and all the products- 
©f their country will we destroy, and scatter the remnants 
thereof to the four winds of heaven. ' 

10 All these things, and more, will we do unto this 
froward people. 

1 1 Neither shall there be found safety for age or sex 
from the destroying swords of the soldiers of the king. 

12 Save in those provinces and towns where dwell the 
friends of the king , for, lo ! said they, the king's friends 
are many. 

13 These will we spare; neither will we hurt a hail 
of their heads : nor shall the savages of the wilderness 
stain the scalping-knife or tlie tomahawk with tlie blcod 
of the hinge's friends. 

14 Now it happened, about this time, that there were 
numbers of the inhabitants of the country of Columbia 
whose hearts yearned after the king of Britain. 

15 And with their false flattering words t'ney led as- 
tray some of the friends of Columbian Liberty ; for 
their tongues were smoother than oil. 

16 Evil machinations entered into their hearts, and 
the poison of their breath might be likened unto the 
deadly Bohon Upas, which rears its lofty branches in 
the barren valley of Java.* 



* Of the existence of this wonderful tree there have 
been doubts : hid the reader is referred to the relation

17 And they strove to dishearten the true friends of 
the great Sanhedrim 5 but they prevailed not. 

18 Moreover, Satan entered into the heart of one of 
the governors of the east, and he was led astray by the 
wickedness thereof, even Caleb the Strong. 

19 Now Caleb, which in the Cherokee tongue, si.jni- 
fieth an ass, liked not the decree of the great Sanhedrim, 

/inasmuch as he favored the king of Britain ; 

20 And, though willing to become a beast of burden, 
yet would he not move on account of his very gi-eat stu- 
pidity. 

21 And he said unto the captains of the hosts of the 
state over which he presided, Lo ! it seemeth not meet 
«nto me that ye go forth to battle against the king. 

22 For, Lo ! are not the fighting men of Britain, ia 
multitude, as the sand on the sea shore? and shall w€^ 
prevail against them ? 

23 Are not the mighty ships of the king spread over 
the whole face of the waters ? Is not Britain the <- bul - 
wark of our religion ?" 

21 Therefore, I commc^nd fh^f, ye go not Out to baW 
tie, but every man remain in his own house. 

25 And all the governors of the east listened unto the 
voice of Caleb. 

26 Moreover, the angel of the Lord whispered inte 
Ihe ear of Caleb, and spake unto him, saying, 

27 If, peradventure, thou dost refuse to obey the laws 
•f the land, the things will not be pleasant in the sight of 

ih: Lord ; 

2S Inasmuch as it may cause the people to rise up cno 
against^another, and spill the blood of their own children ^ 
And tlie time of warfare will be lengthened cnU 
■ho blood of thousands will be upon tlilne head. 



^g HISTORICAL 

30 And Satan spake, and said unto Caleb, Fear not , 
for if thou wilt forsake thy country, and throw oft the 
paltry subterfuge of Columbian Liberty, and defy th. 
councils of the great Sanhedrim, 

31 Then shall thy name be proclaimed with the 
pound of the trumpet throughout all tlie earth «, and thou 
Shalt be a prince and a ruler over this people. 

3^> Now the smooth words of Satan tickled Caleb 
Mightily, and he hearkened unto the counsel of the 

wicked one : 

33 For the good counsel given unto him was as wa- 
ter thrown upon u rock. _^ 

34 But when the chief governor and the great Sanhe- 
drim of the people saw the wickedness of Caleb, their 
^.earts were moved with pity towai-ds him and his follow- ' 
ers : yea, even those who had made a convention at the 
Bttle town of Hartford. 

35 Neither doth the scribe desire to dwell upon the 
rvkkedness which came into the village of Hartford, the 
signification of the name whereof; in the vernaculai^ 

Xovyf^iif^ appcaretli not. 

36 For the meddUng therewith is as the green pool of 
uuckan waters, wh^a a man casteth a stone therein.

OW it was known throughout the land of Columbia 
that war was declared against the kingdom of Britain. 

2 And to a certain chief captain called William, 
whose sir-name was Hull, was given in trust a band of 
more than two thousand chosen men, to go forth to bal" 
tie in the north. 

3 Now Hull was a man well stricken ia years, and he 
had been a captain in the host of Columbia, in the days 
that tried men's souls ; even in the days of Washington* 

4 Therefore, when he appeared in the presence of tht^ 
great Sanhedrim, they were pleased with his counts 
nance, and put much faith in him.* 

5 Moreover, he was a governor in the north,t an.dl 
man of great wealth. 

6 And when he arrived with his army hard by the 
Miami of the Lakes, he gat him a vessel and placed 
therein those things which were appertaining unto the 
preservation of the lives of the sick and the maimed. 

7 But, in an evil hour, the vessel was ensnared, neaj 
unto a strong hold,| beside a river called in the language 

of the Gauls, Detroit.

40 And he encamped his men round about the town 
^f Sandwich in the province of the king. 

1 1 From this place, he sent forth a proclamation, 
■which the great Sanhedrim had prepared for him j and

^Taaster suffer thereby ? if injury can be prevented, shall 

we not rather with our might endeavour to help him ?

abroad, he invited the people of the province of Canada to 
join themselves to the host of Columbia, who were come 
Ho drive the servants of the king from their borders.

OW it came to pass, on the nineteenth day of the 
eighth month, that one of the tall ships of Cokmibia, 
called the Constitution, commanded by Isaac, whose sir- 
name was Hull, 

2 Having spread her whif* wings on the bosom of the 
ftiighty deep, beheld from afar one of the fighting ships 
of l^ritain bearing the royal cross.

rior, and Dacres was the captain thereof. 

4 New when Dacres beheld the ship of Columbia 
liis eyes sparkled with joy, for he had defied the vessels 
of Columbia. 

5 And he spake unto his officers and his men thai 
were under him, saying, 

6 Let every man be at his post, and ere the glass hatii 
passed the third part of an hour the stripes of the Con- 
stitution shall cease to sweep the air of heaven,

8 And the men of Dacres shouted aioud, and. drank 
of the strong waters of Jamaica, which make men mad ; 
moreover, they mixed the black dust therewith. 

9 Now when Isaac drew nigh unto the king's ship, th?- 
t^arriors of Columbia shouted. 

10 And Isaac bore down upon the strong ship of the 
king. 

1 1 About this time they put the lighted match to the 
black dust of the destroying engines, and it was like unto 
a clap of thunder. 

12 JMoreover, the fire and smoke issued out of the 
mouths of the engines in abundance, so as to darken the 
air, and thev were overshadowed by the means there- 
of. 

13 Now the black dust was not known among the art- 
cients ; even Solomon, in the })Iemtude of his wisdom, 
knew it not. 

14 And the battle routinned with tremendous roai 
for about the space of half an hour, when its noises 
ceased. 

1 5 But when the clouds of smoke liad passed awar, 
behold ! the mighty Guerriere lay a sinking wreck upon 
the face of the waters. 

16 The shadow of hope passed over her as a dream ; 
and most reluctantly was she compelled to strike the 
Kon-s red cross to the Eagle of Cohmibia : 

17 Whilst the Constitution, like Shadrach in the 
fiery furnace, remaining unsii^ged, fillod her white 
ftails, and passed along as though nothing had happened 
unto her.

in the Guerriere, that- she miglu be consumedj and X\\q 
■i1?a:aes tliereof mounted towards the heavens. 

21 And the great Sanhedrim honored Isaac with 
great honor, and the people w*ere rejoiced in him, and" 
they forgat, in the contemplation of his glory, the evil 
which had befallen them in the north. 

22 But when the lords and counsellors of Britain 
lieard those things, they believed them not ; it w:as as 
lite bitterness of gall to their souls : for the pride of 
Britain was fixed upon her navy ; it was the apple of

laamed Van Rensselaer, essayed to cross the river which 
is called Niagara, with his whole army. 
f' 3 Now the river lieth between the Lake Erie and the 
Xake Ontario. 

4 And tli€ noise of the waters of the river is louder

rushing of mighty armies to battle.

prepared for them, and they moved upon the rough 
waters of the river, towards the strong hold of Queens- 
town.

.ahey opened the engines upon tbem, from Fort George^ 
and round about.

10 And lie put the army in battle array, in a valley, 
and moved up towards the strong hold; and Brock was 
the chief captain of the host of Britain. 

11 And from their strong, hold they sl*)t, with their 
mischievous engines, balls of lead in abundance ; and it 
was as a shower of hail upon the people of Columbia ; 

12 For there was no turning to the right hand nor to 
tlie left for safety.

rushed into the hottest of the battle.

was Chrystie, followed close after tlrem, witli a chosea 
band of brave men. 

15 So they puslxed forward to the strong hold, and 
drove the men of Britain before them like sheep, and 
smote them hip and thigh with great slaughter ; and 
Brock, their chief captain, was among the skin. 

16 And Chrystie, and the valiant Wool, and Ogil-

and rushed upon tlie people of the United Siaic^i, and 
drove them from the strong hold of Qjicenstown. 

20 For, lo ! Stephen, the chief captain, could not pre- 
vail on the hosts of militia on the other side of the river 
1^0 cross oven 

21 So the army of Columbia moved down towards . 
the river to cross over again, that they migiit escape. 

22 But when they came down to the water side, lo ! 
they were deceived, for there was not a boat to convey 
them to a place of safety j so they became captives to the 
men of Britain. 

23 Now the men of Britain treated the prisoners 
kindly, and showed much tenderness towards them ; for 
which the people blessed them. 

24 And the killed and wounded of the host of Colum- 
bia, were an hundred two score and ten. 

25 And the prisoners that fell into the hands of the 
king, wereabout seven hundred. 

26 Nevertheless, in a letter which Stephen sent to 
Henry,* the chief captain of the army of* the north, he 
gave great honor unto the captains who fought under 
him that day^ 

27 And the nanr^^s of the valiant men, who distin- 
guished themselves m the battle, were Wads worth, Van 
Rensselaer, Scctc, Chrystie, Fenwick, Fink, Gibson, 
and many other brave men of war.

.FTER these things, on the same day in which the

army to a certain chief captain whose name was Alexander^ 

2 Now Alexander was a man well skilled m tlie arts 
of warfare. 

3 And he made a pix)clamafion to the young men of 
the state of New York, wherein he invited them to go forth 
from their homes and join the host under kin).

that they went in numbers and joined Alexander, on tliQ

fdltereth, his heart sickeneth, and he would fain blot 
from his memory that which truth compels him to record; 
for he is a living witness thereof. 

6 Alas I there was an evil spirit moving in secret and 
in bye-places throughout the. land of Columbia. 

7 And lo ! its viper-like insidiousness, crept into the 
ears of the unwary husbandmen. 

8 For the sect of the tories whispered unto them, say-

9 INLoreover, said they, tlie fierceness of the savages is- 
terrible as the vild tyger, and their numbers as the trees 
of the forest. 

10 And the veteran sokhers of the king, who have 
been bred to war, are spread in muhitudes over the pro- 
vince of Canada. 

11 TLlierefore, if ye go over to fight against them, }e 
will be as sheep going to the slaugliter; and ye shall 
never again return to the house of your fathers, for ye 
will be destroyed. 

12 Even as the wickedness of the -vvar, which the 
e;reat Sanhedrim have made against the king cannot 
j)rosper, so shall ye fail a prey to the folly thereof. 

13 And it camete pass when the husbandmen lieard 
. liicse smooth words, many of them w^^re be\vildered iii 

tiieir minds, and knew not what to do. 

14 So when the young men, who had flocked to the 
banners of Alexander, came down to the waters -Gihc^ 
to iro into the boats, they thought of the words which 
the enemies of Columbia had spoken unto them ; and 
they refused to cross over : 

15 Neither could the persuasions of the chief captain 
prevail on them all to go into the boats; and those whose 
hearts were willing were not enough. 

16 So he was obhgtd to suffer them to return tatheir 
homes ; for his expectations were blasted. 

17 And the array of Columbia went into winter 
. quarters ; for the earth was covered with snow, and the 

waters of tlie gi*eat lakes, on the borders of which they 
rhad pitched their tentSj were congealed.

Z Nevertheless, in tjie space of about oinety minutes,

the ^ti-ong slnp of Britain struck her red flag to the

leaped witli joy ; for he dreaded tlie frowns of the king^_ 
and he v/as glad that he stood not alone in the thing. 

21 After this, in the eighteen hundred and thirteenth

Isaac, Decatur, and Jones, in honor of their valiant 
deeds ; and the number of the guests were about five 
hunched.

feast, on the ninth day of the month, for the Drave mari-

29 For a certain mighty ship, called the Southamp- 
ton, fell upon a smaller vessel of the United States,t

OW it came to pass, that the wickedness of Britain 
had roused up the spirit of Satan in the savages of the 
forest, in the north and in the west. 

2 And the tomahawk and the scalping knife were 
raised against the people of Columbia on the borders of 
the great lakes. 

3 So the people sought after a valiant man to go 
against the savages and the men of Britain. 

4 And they pitclied upon a certain governor of one of 
the states in the west, whose name was Harrison,* and 
the great Sanhedrim made him a chief captain of th§. 
army. 

5 jMoreover, he was beloved by the people, and a 
m^dity host of husbandmen v/ere ready to follow after 
him.

chief captain. • 

18 And it was about the dawning of the day, when 
the destructive engines opened their fires. 

19 And the place wliere the battle was fought was 
called, in the vernacular tongue, Frenchtown, which 
iieth on the south side of the River Raisin, nigh unto 
Lake Erie. 

20 Now the name of the chief captain of the army 
of Britain was Proctor, and he proved himself a wicked 
man, and l)is name is despised even unto this day. 

21 And when the battle waxed hot, and they began to 
rush one upon another with great violence, 

22 The small band of Columbia fought desperately, 
and the slaughter was dreadi'ul : and the pure snow of 
heaven was sprinkled and stained with the blood oi

the river, iu the province of the king. 

29 But, in the cruelty of his heart, he left the sick, 
the wounded, and the dying to the mercy of the savages 
of the wilderness ! 

50 In this thing he transgressed the word he had 
pledged, which is evil in the sight of the Lord. 

31 Oh! for a veil to hide in utter darkness the hor- 
rid deeds of that awful day, that they migtit not be 
handed down to the children of men, in the times to

32 Lo ! early in the morning of the next day, ere 
the sun had risen, the work of death began !

forth the shivering soldier over the blood-stained snow 
fainting, bleeding with his wounds, and imploring on his 
knees for mercy. 

34 Alas! the savage understandeth not his words; 
but giveth him a blow with the hatchet of death. 

35 For have not the counsellors of Britain said, For 
this will we give unto you silver and gold ? 

36 Thus were the poor wounded prisoners of Co-

not ; 

9 Which caused the gallant captain, whose sir-name

gines. 

10 And it was about the second hour after the mid- 
day, v/hen the sound of the battle-drum was heard. 

11 And, as tbey approached towards each other, th^t

strove to avoid the balls of lead, and the heavy balLs of

20 And the ship of Britain had become a wreckj 
and the deck thereof was covered with blood ! 

21 Nevertheless, the ♦servants of the king struck not 
the flag of Britain ; for they were loth and hesitated ; 

22 But when Bainbridge, who saw this, came down 
upon them a second time, they kumbled themselves, 
and drew down the British cross. 

23 And the slain and the wounded of the king, that 
day, were an hundred three score and ten ; 

24 And those of the people of Columbia, were about 
thirty and four. 

25 Moreover, Bainbridge, the captain of the vessel 
of the United States, was sorely wounded. 

26 And Lambert, the captain of the ship of the 
kiixg, w^as wounded, even unto death. 

27 Now when the servants of the king were taken 
from tlie wreck, and meat and drink sat before them, 
t It tliey might be refreshed, they partook thereof and

28 And on the second day Bainbridge put a match 
to the black dust that remained in the ship, and she 
burst asunder, and rent the air with a loud noise. 

29 And the fragments thereof were spread upon tlie 
waters round about. 

50 And the fish of the sea, even the mighty whales, 
fled from ilie noise of the explosion.

seized the tyrants of the ocean.

gaped one upon another, and wist not what to say.

deceived, thinking it was a merchant's vessel. 

19 Therefore he was cojnpelledto fight ; so he open- 
ed upon tlie vessel of the king, one of his mischievous- 
engines called, in the vernacular tongue, Long-Tom. 

2iO And they fought hard, a;nd the noise of the engines 
was very great. 

21 And the halls of lead and iron showered around 
like hail-stones ; for the strong ship of Britain had them 
in abundance. 

22 Now the sfoughter was dreadful- on both sides.,- 
and Guy was on the point of making capture of the 
ship : but he received a wound, and his vessel was disa- 
bled, so he made good his escape. 

23 And the slain and the wounded of Guy were 
twenty and three, and the vessel of the king lost about 
Iwice that number. 

24 Now, for this valiant ael, Guy gat great honor, 
sind the people give him as word of fine workmanship. 

25 Moreover, the Saratoga, the Scourge, the Chaufs- 
seur, and many other private vessels of the people of the 
United States, were a grievous plague to the servants of 
the king ; 

26 Inasmuch as sonae of them made sport with the 
mighty blockade of Britain, which she piat forth against' 
tlie free people of the land of Columbia. 

27 For when they caime nigh unto the #oast of Britain^ 
they made capture and burnt the vessels of ihe king, that 
^carried richjmcrchandise, costly jewels, and silver and gold. 

25 Yea, even iu their own waters, and in the sight Of 
ihm own havens, did they do ||>es€ thmgis.

29 For it liappened t^at the cumiing Yankees knew 
how to construct the swift-sailing vessels, that they out- 
ran the strong vessels of Britain. 

30 And as the ships of Britain moved but slowly on 
the waters, so they caught thein not, 

3 1 Wherefoi e the artlBcerSj the mechanics, and thos« 
who dealt in merchandise, ralised their vckcs to the gr-eat 
council of Britain, saying, 

32 Lo ! are we not the faithful servants of tho king, 
^r master ? have we not given unto him the one half of 
,our whole substance ? and shall these Yankees take 
from us the remainder ? 

S3 Hath not the knag a thousand ships of war ? and 
wherefore should we be hemmed in ? 

34 Lo ! our merchant vessels are idle ! neither caii 
"we pass in safety even unto the land ctf Hibernia, which 
lieth nigh unto u8. 

35 And, behold, the captain of a private armed ves- 
sel of the Yankees, in derision of the proclamat on o[ 
our lord the king, hath proclaimed the island of Great 
Uritain and her dependencies in a state of rigouroie 
blockade ; saying, Lo ! I have the power to hem ye ill. 

36 Therefore, let the counsellors of the king ponder 
these things, and let the strong ships of Britain drive tke 
vessels of Columbia from our coast. 

37 Now the wisemen of Britain heard those things wit^ 
sorrow ; and they spake one to another concerning the 
matter : 

38 But they wist not what to ; for the cunning of the 
captains of the fast sailing vessels of Columbia, surpass^ 
M the wisdom of the lords of Britain.

couched down as a lion j and, as a young lion, they 
wa.ched for their prey.' 

4 The tall and leafless trees of the forest bent to the

as t' e roaring of mighty waters. 

5 Moreover, the face of the earth was covered w)i^ 
snow, and the water of the ivers was frozen. 

6 And the borders of Columbia, nigh unto the pro«

the enemy.

2 The country of Columbia is a wide extended land, 
which reacheth from the north to the south, more than 
eight thousand miles 5 and the breadth thereof is aboitt 
three thousand. 

3 Moreover tlie name of the country v/as called after 
the name of a great man, who was born in a place crilecl 
Genoa ;, beisg in Italia, on the sea-coast. 

4 His name was Christopher, sir-named Columbute 

5 As the righteous man struggleth against wickedness, 
so did he against ignorance and stupidity. 

6 Neverthelesf , it came to pass, in the fourteen bus- 
dred and ninety second year of the Christian era, that he 
crossed the waters of the mighty deep, a thing that had 
iiever been known among the sons of men. 

7 And the place where he landed was an island ia 
the sea, nigh uirto the continent of Columbia, called Sao 
Salvador 5 which, being interpreted, signifietli a place of 
safety. 

8 And ibe place was inliahited by wild" savages, andi 
they were naked, 

9 Now when the people heard that Columbus ha« 
i fimnd a new landj they were astonished beyond Bacci'^grej 



74 HISTORICAL 

for it was many tJhoasand miles cff ; moreover, some of 
them strove to rob h.\m of the honour, and he was tjeated 
wrongrully, 

10 But his name was lifted up above his enemies^ and 
it shall not be lost. 

1 1 Now the land of Columbia is a most plentiful land^ 
yielding gold and silver, and brass and iron abundantly. 

12 Likewise, all manner of creatures which are used 
lor food, and herbs and fruits of the earth : 

13 From the red cherry, and the rosy peach of the 
-morth, to the lemon, and the pjolden orange of the south. 

14 And from the small insect, that cheateth the mi- 
croscopic eye, to the huge mammoth that once moved on 
the borders of the river Hudson ; on the great river 
Ohio; and even down to the country of Patagonia in 
the south. 

15 Now ihe heighth of a mammoth is about seveis 
qeubits and a half, and the length thereof fourteen cu- 
bits ; and the bones thereof being weighed are more than 
thirty thousand shekels ; and the length of the tusks is 
more than six cubits. 

16 It is more wonderful than the elephant ; and th« 
history thereof, is it not r^eeorded in the book of Jeffer- 
son, the sca'ibe ?* 

17 The fierce tyger and the spotted leopard dwell 
in the dark forests ; and the swift-footed deer upon 
the mountains and high places. 

18 Now the number of inhabitants that are spread 
over the whole continent, is more than an hundred mil- 
lion. 

* Jeffenan's notes on Virginia, 



19 And the people of Columbia, who are indepen- 
dent of the tyrants of the earth, and who dwell betweea 
the great riycr which is called Mississippi, in the south^ 
and the province of Canada in the north, being number-" 
cd, are about ten thousand times ten thousand souls.* 

20 The men are comely and noble, and cowardice 
hath forgot to light upon thetn : neither are they a su- 
perstitious people ; they are peace-makers, tlu^y love 
the God of Israel, and worship him 5 and there are no 
idolaters ainonost them. 

21 The women are passing beautiful ; they are lik« 
unto fresh Hlies ; their cheeks are like wilil roses ; their 
lips as a thread of scarlet; nature hath gifted them with 
Koman virtue and patriotism ; acd they have spiedd 
goodness with a plentiful hand. 

22 Now it had happened in times past that the Idng 
-of Britain had made war upon the people of Columbia, 
fven forty years ago. 

23 For the riches and prosperity of Columbia had

neither did their footsteps follow after warfare. 

5 And, it is written in the holy scriptures. Blessed 
are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the chil-

6 So the great Sanhedrim of the people sent two of 
the wise men of Columbia, the one named Gallatin and 
the other Bayard, into a distant country :

to rage.

month, in the pleasant season of the j'car ; v/heu the 
trees put forth their leaves and the air is perfumed with 
the sweet sceut of flowers, and the blue violets bespread 
the green hillocks ; 

10 That HarrisoPi; the chief captain, from the west 
the brave warrior, who had entreuched himself in the 
f trong hold of Meigs, nigh unto the river Miami, sallied 
forth against the savages a ^,u the men of Britain, that 
bemmed him in. 

11 Now there were about a thousand soldi-frs of the 
king, and a thousand savages that had besieged the fort 
many days ; and threw therein the balls of destruction^ 
and strove to make captive the army of Columbia. 

12 Nevertheless, Harrison, and his gallant little band, 
fought hard against them, and drove tljem from before 
the strong hold with great slaughter. 

13 Likewise, the slain of Columbia was about foiur 
sccre, besides the wounded. 

14 Moreover, the chief captain gave great honour to 
Miller and all the captains and soldiers under himj even 
those called milicia.

51 His body was conveyed to a place called Halifax^

32 But in a short time thereafter his body was fake»

33 And the captain's name who volunteered his ser-

bodies av/ay from Halifax, was Crowningshield, of

3 A band of the mQ'.\ of Britain crossed over th6 
water from Chippawa to a [.lace called Fcit Schlosser. 

4 And there was a handl'ial of tlie men of the United 
Stateaun the place, whom iY.ey made- captive, being 
twelve in number. 

5 Likewise, they carried away the bread and the 
meat, and some of the strong waters j also one of the 
destroying engines. 

6 Moreover, the eno;ine which they brought away was 
made partly of brass, partly of iron, and partly of wood. 

7 And the weight of the ball that issued out of its 
mouth was about two hiinderd sliekcls, after the shekel 
of the sanctuary.

camp with fire, and carried away the flour, and the salt, 
and such things as tliey stood in need of. 

10 However, while they #ere yet carrying them a-

12 And they fled hastily away, leaving nine of tueir 
slain behind, and more than half a score of cap- 
tives. 

13 The soldiers of the king were commanded by 
two men, the one called Bishop and the other Warren, 
and the men of Columbia were commanded by a cheif 
captain, named Porter.* 

14 About this time the savages and the" men of war 
of Britain assailed the guards and the out-posts near 
unto Fort George 

15 Day after day and night after night did they an- 
noy them ; and many were slain on both sides. 

16 And Dearborn, the chief captain of the fort, and of 
the host of Columbia round about Niagara, becam.e sick 
afld unable to go out to battle. 

17 So Boyd, a brave and tried warrior, was made 
chief captain in his stead, until Wilkinson, the chief

EVERTIIELESS, it came to pass, that Kariaonj 
the chief captain of the north west army, had placed 
a captain, a young man, in the hold called Fort Stephen- 
son, to defend it. 

2 Now the fort lieth at the western end of the great 
lake Erie, at a place called Sandusky. 

3 And the number of the soldiers that were with the 
3'outh in the held was about an hundred and three score, 
and they had only one of the destroying engines. 

4 Now the name of the young man was George, and 
his sir-namiC was Croghan. 

5 So, on the first day of the eighth month, about the 
going down of the sun, a mighty host from Maiden ap- 
peared before the hold. 

6 Even a thousand savages, and about five lumdred 
men. of war of Britain 5 and Proctor was the commrandcr 
thereof. 

7 Moreo-'cr, they brought the instruments of destruc- 
•ion ill ereat plenty ; even howitzers, which were not 
I ::)ov;ii ki the days of tlie children of Israel. 

'•! /iiiJ tliey had prepared themselves for the figh?" 



and encompassed the place round about, both by land 
and by water. 

9 After v/hich Proctor sent a message to the brave 
Croghaii, by a captain whose name was Elliot, and iLj 
words thereof were in this sort : 

10 Lo ! now ye cnn neither move totlicridit hop t ■ 
the left, to escape ; for we have hemmed 3^011 iii ; 

1 1 Therefore, that your blood may not be spili in v.h , : , 
we command that ye g'ive up the strong hold into tli 
kaads of the servants of the king, and become captives. 

12 We have the destroying engines in abundance, and 
we are a numerous host. 

13 Furthermore, if ye refuse then shall th^ wild sa- 
vages be let loose upon you ; and there snail be none left 
among you to go and tell the tidings thereof. 

14 But when Croghan heard the mesi-c^-. he -^n^wer- 
ed and said unto EHiot, Get thee now to ihy r^.i' f c'p- 
tain, and say unto liim. [ relase ; neitiier wili i hearkenv

15 And if it be so-, that he come against me with hi:; 
whole host, even then will I not turn aside from the 
fierce battle 5 thougli his numbers were as the sand oi-i 
the sea shore. 

16 Lo ! David, of old, with a sling and a stone, slew^ 
the mighty Goliah : and shall the people of Columbia be 
afraid, and bow before the tyrants of Europ>e ? 

17 Then Elliot returned to the army of the king : and 
immediately the mouths of their engines were opeiied 
against the fort. 

1 'S And the noise thereof continued a long time ; even 
until the next day ; but thair battering prevailed not. 
19 ?'''ow when Procter '1V7/ it was of no avail, he di-

o "Irrcover, I'le oreat Sanhedrim of the people

4 And it came to pass, that tiiere v/as a dreadful 
battle fought i)ctv\'een a vessel of the king, and a private 
V ^sel of Columbia. 

5 Andthena-me of the vessel that fought was De- 
critur, and the captain's name was Diron, a Gaid. 

|6 And it was so, that about the fourth day of the 
eighth month, the Decatur having sailed out of the ha- 
ven of Charleston, being in the state of South Carohna, 
fell in with one of the tighting vessels of the king, called 
the Dominica. 

7 But the destroying engines of the king^'s vessel 
were two fold greater in numbers than those of th.e 
D-ecatnr. 

K 



106 HISTORICAL 

8 Nevertheless, they set thorn to work, so that they 
groaned beneath the fire and sjiioke ; 

9 And in about the space of an liour the Dominica 
was conquered and taken cajdive. 

10 For when the vessels came close together, the 
men smote one ajiother with their swards atid weapou'S 
of wkr ; yea, even ti!c I'alls of iron they cast at eacJi 
otiier, with their hands, and slew, one another with 
wonderful slaughter. 

11 Inasmuch as there were slain and i:{>aiiiic(l oftlie 
king three score souls ; those of tlie Decatnr were 
about a score : moreover the ca|.iain of the Doniiniea 
was slain. 

12 The fight was an unequal one ; and the bravery 
t)f Diron gained him a great name, for he overcame the 
enemies of freedom 5 although their force was greater 
than his. 

13 After this, on the fourteentji day of the same 
month, there was another sore battle between a small 
vessel of the United States, called the Argus and the 
Fclican, a ship of the Idng. 

14 Now the Pelican was somewhat stronger than the 
.\rgus, and tliey were stubborn and kept the destroying 
engines to work, wi*h great noise about forty .and fiv 
minutes. 

15 And the brave captain of the Argus, wh.ose name 
was Allen, was wounded unto death, and the vessel of 
Columbia was captured by the ship of Britain, tlie name 
of the commander whereof was Maples. 

16 Of the men of Columbia six were slain and 
seventeen wounded ; of the men of Britain the slaip 
and wounded were five.

READER. 107 

IT Now the fkath of Allen was spoken of with sor- 
row /throughout the land of Columbia, for he had de-= 
fjpifded the vessel of the United States nobly : and cap- 
tured some mercliant ships of Britain. 

1 8 Even the enemy regarded him for his bravery, 
for they buried him with lionour in their own country, 
not far from the place where he became captive, w^iich 
was in the waters of the king, even in St. George^s 
Channel. 

19 But k came to pass, on the fifth day of the ne?rt 
month, in the sanle year, 

20 That a certain small vess^^l of Columbia, carrying 
the engines of destruction, commanded by a gallant 
man, whose name was Burrows, fell in with an- 
other small vessel of the king, called the Boxer and 
the captain thereof was a brave man, and his name was 
Blythe. 

21 In the language of the people of the land, the 
vessel of Columbia was called the Enterprize. 

22 Now when the vessels drew »igh unto each other 
the men shouted with loud shouting. 

23 And iminediately they let the mischievous engines 
loose upon one another, with a noise like unto thunder. 

S4 But it happened, that in about the space of forty 
minutes, the Boxer was overcome j but she was taken 
somewhat unawares : 

25 For, lo ! the pride of the men of Britain l;ad made 
them foolish : and, thinking of the conquest, they nailed 
Britannia'^: red-cross to the mast of the vessel. 

26 Vv' hereupon, after they were overcome, they cried 



108 HISTORICAL 

27 Behold ! our colors are fast ; and we cannot 
quickly unloose them ; nevoftheless, we will be prisoners 
unto you. therefore spare us. 

28 So the brave mariners of Columbia spared them, 
and stopped the destroying engines ; for their hearts 
were inclined to mercy. 

29 However, this was another bloody fight ; for 
tliere fell of the men of Britain forty that w^ere slain out- 
right, and seventeen were wounded. 

30 And the loss of Columbia in slain and maimed 
was about fourteen. 

31 And the commanders of both vessels were slain ; 
and they buried them with honor in the tov/n of Port- 
land, which leaveth Boston to the west ; for the battle 
was fought hard by. 

32 Moreover, the great Sanhedrim was pleased with 
ilie thing, and gave unto the nearest kinsman of Burrows 
a medal of gold, in token of remembrance thereof.*

ilO HISTORIC AL 

3 Now about this time tlie strong vessels of Cohiinbia 
tiiat moved upon the face of the blue waters of tlie great 
'ake Erie, were given in charge to Oliver, whose sir- 
name was Perry. 

4 And he was a piudent man, and had prepared him- 
self to meet the vessels of the king, even forty days before- 
hand. 

5 And the name, of of the captain of the fleet of Bri- . 
tain was Barclay, a man of great valor ; but he boasted 
and was vain of his fleet, for it was more powerful 
than the fleet of Columbia. 

6 Nevertheless, it came to pass, in the one thousand 
eight hundred and thirteenth year, on the tenth day of 
the ninth month, early in tlie morning, about the rising 
of the sun, 

7 Tife valiant Perry beheld the fleet of the king at a 
distance upon tlie lake ; so he unmoored his vessels 
and went out to meet them in battle array, fleet against 
:fleet. 

8 And when their white sails were spread upon the 
bosom of the lake, they appeared like unto a squadron of 
passing clouds. 

9 A gentle breeze wafted the hostile vessels towards 
one another. 

10 It was silence upon the waters; save when the 
sound of musical instruments fell sv/eetly upon tlie 
ear. 

11 But it happened, a little before the mid-day, that 
the shouts of the men of war of Britain were heard, and. 
the shouts of the men of, Columbia. 

12 And now the destroying engines began to utt^; 



READER. in 

their thunders vomiting forth fire and smoke and brim- 
stone in abundance. 

13 And suddenly the waters were in an uproar ; and 
the bellowing noises sounded along the lake. 

14 Moreover, the chief fo.'ce of the ships of the king 
was put against the vessel in which Perry was ; 

15 And the vessel was called the Lawrence, after a 
brave man, Avhose dying words waved upon her aloft : 

16 Now, behold, a thousand balls of iron skim the 
surface of the wafers, swift as shooting stars. 

17 But when the battle waxed hot, and Perry saw 
that the tackling of his vessel was shot away, and his men 
were slain and wounded with great slaughter, and his des- 
troying engines became silent, 

18 He put the charge of the vessel into the hands of 
one of his officer*, whose name was Yarnell, a trusty man « 

19 Then, with the starry banner of Columbia in his 
hand, did the gallant Perry leap into his cock-boat, while 
his brave mariners quickly conveyed him to another 
fighting vessel of the United States called the Niagara, 
commanded by a valiant man, whose name was Elliot. 

20 After this again the vessels uttered (heir thunders 
and fought hard, and the men of Columbia poured out 
destruction upon the servants of the king. 

21 And it came to pass, that the skilful contrivance of 
Perry, and the bravery of his men, at length forced the 
whole fleet of the king to become captive— even unto the 
cock-boats of Columbia. 

22 Thus again was the mighty lion Lumbled before 
the eaale : for six strong vessels of Britain were overcome 
at one time.

f5 And the slain and wounded of the king that day, 
was about an hundred thirty and five ; beside there were 
a thousand prisoners. 

24 The loss of the United States was twenty and se- 
ver, tliat were killed, and four score and ten were wound- 
ed. . 

25 Moreover, the number of the men of Britain made 
captive was more than all the men of Perry's squadron. 

26 Now Perry was a righteous man, and like the good 
Samaritan, took care of tli€ haU and maimed, and put 
skilful men to bind up their wounds; and the men of 
Britain blessed liim. 

27 Neither was he a man pulled up with vanity, even 
m the hour of victory ; 

28 For when he had conquered the fleet of Britain, 
he wrote to Jones,* one of the scribes of the great San- 
hedrim, with modesty, saying, 

29 To day it hath pleased the -Lord that ihe people of 
Columbia should triumph o\^r their enemies. 

30 At the sam.e time he Vvrote to Harrison, the chiti 
captain of the host of Colum])ia, whose army was at th« 
bay of Sandusky, saying, We have met the enemy, cmd 
they ar*^ ours ! 

3 1 'I hea did the ener.iies of Columbia weep ; and the 
gainsayer put on deep mourning. 

32 Moreover, the great Saahtdrjyn honored Perr}^ vviih 
great honor; and gave him med.iis, with devkes curiou!;"

J-^ OW when Perry had taken care of the captives, 

and the wounded, and set them upon the shore, 

2 He began to convey the army of Harrison from 
Fort Meigs and round about. 

3 And having gathered tliem together into his vessels, 
he brought them, and landed them nigh unto the strong 
hold of Maiden. 

4 And it came to pass, on the twentj^-ihird day of 
the same month, in winch Perry con.piered the fleet of 
Britain, 

5 That Harrison, the chief captain, began to march 
ihehost of Columbia against the strong hold of Maiden, 
and captured a tovv-n called Amherstburg, nigh there- 
unto. 

6 Now Proctor was the chief captain of the savage? 
and servants of the king. 

7 And when he saw the men of Columbia approach, 
he destroyed the fort, the tenls, and the store-houses 
of the king, and, with his v/holc ho^.t, fled swiftly

S And Hairison, and the host cf Columbia, followed 
hard after him. 

9 Now when the savages of the wilderness beheld 
the men of Britain flee befjrc the warriors of Columbia, 
their spirits sunk, and they were sore amazed.^-

us to fight alone. 

13 Whereupon niiny of t'leir tribes cast av/ay tiieir

the king. 

14 And when Harrison, came to Sandwich,. Proctov 
and his army had departed from tlie place, and fled to-

15 (Now the Thames emptieth its waters into the 
lake St. Clair, and the Moravian Towns lie upon tiie 
river, about an hundred miles from Maiden, tov/ards tht" 
north, in the province of Upper Canada.) 

16 Moreover, as they jour nied on, the brave rvl* Ar-

18 So INFArthuFj in ^/hom the chief captain put 
mucli faith, remained at Detroit in the charge thereof. 

19 And it came to pass, when Harrison saw that the

of tb.erext month. 

20 And his whole army followed after him, in all a-

the state of Kentucky and the pleasant villages of 
Ohio.

5 Moreover, they were a nation of savages that 
'dwelt in the back-woods and the wilderness round about 
the states of Georgia, Tennessee, and the Mississippi 
Territory. 

6 So, about this time, they took their weapons of

32 And so the judgment of the Lord fell upon them 
for their unrigliteousness, and for their wicked and mur-- 
tierous deeds^ 

33 After which they repented of their evil, having^ 
through their own folly, lost many thousand warriors. 

34 And their chief warriors gave up their instru-

Jackson, the chief captain. 

(| 35 Even Wetheribrd, the chief v/arrior, gave him-

37 So the warriors and the whole nation of the

38 Lo ! now are our eyes opened to our own profit | 
BOW will we make peace with yoii. 

39 And if ye will no more suffer the fire, and the 
sword, and the destroying engines to spread desolatien

40 Then will we make a covenant with you, and give 
you for an inheritance a great part of the land which 
our fathers inherited before us. 

41 4nd the iength and the breadth thereof shall be 
about as large as the whole island of Britain, whose

42 For although the king, who calleth himself our fa-

death into our hands, and givews the black dust in abun- 
dance ; nevertheles!*, he deceived us ; and in the hour of 
^ang^r his servants left, us to take care of ourselves. 

43 So Jackson made a covenant with them; and it 
was signed by the chiefs of their nation. 

44 And after it had been examined by the wise men 
and the great Sanhedrim of the people, it was ratified 
and signed with the hand -writing of James, the chief 
governor of the land of Columbivi.

S He is wise in his own conceit, but his wisdom

4 Now the country of Columbia was assailed on every

5 And in the hope that the war might speedily cease^ 
and an end be m.ade of the shedding of blood, the great

Fort George and the country of Niagara, to Sackctl'i. 
Harbor, at the east end of lake Ontario ; leaving Har- 
rison and M'Clure behind, at the strong hold of Fort 
George. 

9 From Sackett''s Harbor Ai'^ilkinsen moved to a 
place called Grenadier Island; and in the first week of 
llie eleventh month he arrived at Ogdensburgh, in order 
to go against the strong hold of Montreal. 

10 Now the army 6f Hampton rested nigh unto lake 
Cham plain ; and about the same time he moved towards 
^he borders of the king. 

11 And Wilkinson sent a messenger to him, and en- 
treated him to come and -meet him, and join the two ai:- 
mies at the village of St. Regis. 

12 The same night Wilkinson with his army crossed 
the great river St. Lawrence, near by the strong hold 
of Prescot, which lieth in the dominions of the king. . 

13 And he moved down with about six thousand men 
towards the hold of Montreal, until he came to a place, 
called Crystler's Farms, nigh unto Williamsburgh. 

14 Now, at this place^ on the eleventh day of the 
eleventh month, a strong band of the men of war of 
Britain, from Kingston and round about, fell upon his 
army in the rear, and annoyed them greatly. 

15 At length, on the same day, a part of the army 
of Columbia turned about, and fought against them and 
drove them back ; however it was a sore fight. 

16 Wilkinson, the chief captain, who went before- 
Xht host of Columbia, had been sick muny days^ and 
^7as unable to go forth against them hiingelf^ 



WAH. 133 

17 So lie sent some of his brave captains, even 
Boyd, and Swartwout, and Covington; and the en- 
gines of destruction were set to work witli great noise 
and fury; and the valiant Covington was. wounded unto 
death. 

18 Moreover, the loss of the men of Columbia that 
day was an hundred slain, and two hundred two score 
and ten wounded, and tlie loss of the king was about an 
hundred four score and one. 

19 After this battle the army of Wilkinson moved 
along the St. Lawrence until they came to Baniheart^s, 
near Cornwall, where they met the vahant Brown. 

20 Now this place lieth en the north side of the river, 
and on the other side lieth St. Regis, where V/ilkiuson, 
the chief captain, expected to lie joined by the army of 
Hampton, from Champlain. 

21 Bat in this he was disappointed ; for, lo ! Hamp- 
t<»nsent one of his captains, whose name vvas Atkinson, 
to Wilkinson, with the tidings that he had declined t© 
meet him, nnd was returnin"- to his camp on tli^ lake. 

22 Now when the army of Wilkinson heard those 
ihino-s, they were discowra^red; and all the plans tha.t 
had been devised by Armstrong,* thp chi^f ca itain, 
and scribe of the o^reat Sanhedrim, were of no avail. 

23 So the army of Wilkinson crossed the river ii-rmii 
and ca^iie into the land of Columbia, at French Mills, 
near St. Regis; where they went into winter qnar- 
ters.

not the people of Columbia. 

9 1 he men of Columbia were not cruel, and they 
put none of the inhabitants of the town to the sword. 

10 After this, it came to pass, on the nineteenth

OW whilst the great lakes and rivers were bound 
in fetters of ice, and the arms of Columbia slumbered in 
the winter camps of the north ; 

2 And whilst the conquering sword of Jackson 
spread ruin and desolation among the misguided savages 
of the south ; 

3 Lo ! new scenes of warfare appeared upon the wa- 
ters of the great deep. 

4 Tn the first year of the war David, whose sir- 
name v/as Porter, sailed from the shores of Columbia 
tov/ards the south, that he might capture the vessels of 
the men of Britain. 

5 And the ship which he commanded was one of 
tlie strong vcsocls of Columbia, called tke Essex. 

6 ^>ow David was a valiant man, and he had con- 
trived a plan to annoy the commerce of Britain in the 
waters pf the great Pacific Ocean. 

7 So, in process of time, he passed around, the fur- 
thermost part of the land of Columbia, whidi is called 
Cape Horn, and lieth far to the south ; near the country 
of Patagonia, which is inhabited by the barbariansj ar.d. 
sailed towards the haven of V alparaiso. 



WAR. 139 

From whence, leaving Chili t& the south, he mov- 
ed along the coast of Peru, till he came to Lima, where 
it never rains : 

9 A country where gold and silver ar%; found in 
abundance, and where there is one continual summer^ 
and the trees blossom throughout the year. 

10 Again, '.e prepared his vessels, and sailed from 
Lima towards the north, until he fell upon the islands of 
Gallapagos ; called the enchanted islands. 

1 1 Now these islands lie upon the west side of the 
great continent of Columbia, .under a meridian sun, be« 
ncath the girdle of the world. 

12 Hereabouts he captured a multitude of the mer- 
chant ships of Britain, laden with rich merchandize, and 
silver a»d gold. 

13 And he fixed a score of the destroying engines 
into one of the ships he had taken; and made her a 
fighting vessel, and called her name Essex Junior, and 
a man, whose name was Downs, he made captain 
thereof. 

14 And he fell upon the fishermen of Britain, and 
captured those who went out to catch the mighty 
whales, which afibrd oil to give us light in the night 
time, and bones to shade our daughters from the scorch- 
ing sun of the noon-day. 

15 Moreover, David went to an island where dwelt 
wild savages, and established himself, so that he could 

j go out and return whensoever he chose. 

16 Akd when he departed from the island, which he 
called after the chief governor of the land of Columbia

in ^osd chys,* he left some of his men, with the we^pom^ 
©f war to defend the place. 

17 Now David was a grievous thorn m the side of.' 
Britain, and h« almost destroyed her whole commerce 

in the South Seas : , M„„f«, 

18 Inasmuch as he put the wise men of the king to 
their wits end; for they were unable to out-sail him 
£ik1 take him captive. 

19 So they sent their strong ships in search ol him, 
by two's, over th^ whole tace of the waters of the 
South^^rn Ocean ; and the expense thereof would have 
made more than two feasts for the Prince l^egent, who 
rrnxemed En;;land in the name of his father. 

* 20 However, it came to pa.s that David returned 
acraln in his ship to the haven of Valparaiso ; and the 
vessel, called the Essex Junior, accompanied him. 

\l Now Downs, who commanded her, had been ta 
the place before, and conducted the pri.esof David there, 
and brought hhn the tidings that he was likely to be cn^ 

snared upon the waters. 

9o So whil-rt David wr,s there, on the twrnty-ei-hth

of Columbia abundantly, f

2S But Hilly ar. tlie captain of the king's ship colledt' 
ijie Piui^bp, was aiVfiid lest he shouiu be overcome. 

29 Now, when David found he was unable to make 
'good his escajie^ he drew nigh the land, that he might 
be protected by the great iaw of nations 5 for it was a- 
place friendly to both parlies. 

.SO But in this lie was deceived; for the authorities

35 So, after David had fought hard, he became cap-

3(3 Moreover, Hillyar gave him praise and called 
him a man of courage ; for he fought against two strong 
ships of Britain.

iden, that they might return in iier again to their own

7 Lo ! it was a night dark and gloomy j and the 
very clouds of heaven wept for the folly of man.* 

8 Quickly did the weapons of murder disturb aii<i 
tfoiible the general silence. 

9 Their thunders roared around the battlements; 
and the sudden blaze, from the engines, was as a thou- 
sand flashes of lightning. 

10 But tlie men of Columbia were not asleep; 
for they met them at the onset : thrice the men of Bii- 
tahi came ; and thrice were they driven back. 

11 About this time/ a man of Columbia, who was 
sorely wounded, begged of an officer of the king that 
his life might be spared ; 

12 But the captain, whose name was I>rummond,t 
in whom he spake, refused him quarters ; and, taking 
an oath, he swOre, and cursed the men of Columbia, 
saying, Even as I slay thee, so shall it be with ye ail. 

13. Thus violating the commandment of God, which 
sayeth. Thou shalt do no murder. 

14 But the hand of the Lord was stretched out 
agalnstjhiin : for while he was yet speaking, in the 
wickedness of his heart, he was smitten dead to the 
earth. 

15 Now, although the men of Britain did some 
iujury to the fort, tliey were quickly compelled to de- 
part.

captives. 

17 The loss of the United States was about an 
himch-ed men. 

1 S Now it came to pass, on the seventeenth day of 
tiie next month, when Jacob was recovered of his 
vf ouiids, and had resumed his command, he sallied om: 
of Fort Erie with his men, and went against the camp 
of the servants of the kin^. 

19 And by his bravery and skill, and that of the 
valiant captains under him, he took and destroyed 
their strong holds, and slew many of them, -so ihat 
their loss . was about a thousand fighting men. 

20 And the slain and wounded of Jacob's army 
.i^vere two hundred ninety and nine. 

21 Now the vaHant deeds of Jacob, and his brave 
jaen, are they not written in all the books of the chroni- 
cles of the land of Columbia of that day ? 

22 After this, on the twenty-first day of the same 
month, the chief captain, and the host of Britain, being 
tired of the noise of the destroying engines of the men 
of Columbia, went away from the place and rested at 
Queenstown.

_ft-N these uays the strong po^vers of Britaui strove 
hard to queuch the fire of Coluaibian Liberty, 

2 But it was lighted up by tlie hand of heaven, and 
not to be extinguisiied. 

3 Now it came to pass, on the ninth day of the eighth

4 Th.«t the mighty ships of Britain came and opened 
their thundering eng-jnes upon ihe httie town of ^tou-

5 But the inhabitants of the place were b<;M and 
valiant men, and they scorned to make a covenant v\'ith 
the servants of the knig. 

6 Altliough Hardy,* the chief captain of the king's 
ships had threatened to destroy the place; sayinr, b.e-

them pl'^ntifally, and com^.diej them to depart: 

9 Notwithstanding, they had but two of the destroj'- 
ing enirinos ia the place. 

10 However, on the eleventh day of the same month, 
they were .;gain forced to put them hi motion. 

11 For, in the meantime, Hardy had sent a messen' 
ger to the inhabitants, saying, 

12 If ye will not prove wicked, and will refrain from 
sending your evil torpedoes amongst our vessels, therj 
will we spi.re your town. 

13 Now Hardy was mightily afraid of these torpe- 
does, (the history whereof is written in tlie fiftieth 
book of these chronicles) and he trembled at the sound' 
of the name thereof. 

14 Nevertheless, the people of Stonlngton refused 
his request. 

15 So the ships of Britain came again tind they 
brought another strong ship of the king to help them to 
take the place. 

16 i3ut once more the valiant sons of Connecticut 
made them fly for safety : and they came not again. 

17 And the gallant conduct of the people of Ston- 
ington gained them much praise, even from the great 
Sanhedrim of the people. « 

18 Thus would the men of Columbia have done, in 
many other places, but for the false words and wicked- 
ness of trait or QU5 men.

other friends of the land of Columbia. 

9 Nevertheless, the wisdom of all their plans failed 
them ; and they were sorely grieved to behold the hus-

flee before the host of Britain.

21 So when tlie servants of the king came to the 
place, they looked around, in surprise, and cried out 
tvilh astonishment, saying, 

21 Lo ! the city hath fled with the people, tbr there 
are but rai handful of houses in the place. 

23 However, the next day they began the worko^ 
destruction, like unto the barbarians of ancient times • 
for their wickedness followed after them as the shadow 
followeth after the substance. 

24 And they destroyed the beautiful ediiices with fire, 
even the palace of the great Sanhedrim. 

25 Now Cockburn was loath that his wicked deeds 
should be handed down to future generations j so he 
v/ent and destro3'ed, with his own hands, the chief 
printing-ofnce* of the city, and scattered the types 
abroad ; 

IC) Because, as he alledged, the printer had, in times 
past, uttered many hard things against him. 

27 Til IS did he, even Cockburn, like an ignorant 
savage, stamp his own name with infamy, and make it 
become a reproach amongst all mankind. 

28 Science and learning blushed at the champions

gan to open the eyes of man, and to destroy the poison-

31 Moreover, to complete the vandalism of Cocl;- 
burn and Ross, they fell upon the printed books of the 
great Sanhedrim. 

32 Even those that had been gathered together fof 
instruction ; the toil of many years ; containing the 
learning and wisdoim of ages. 

33 And they consumed them with fire ; thus striving 
taturn man back to the ages of ignorance and dark- 
ness. 

34 Now, Thomas, whose sir^iame was Jefferson, 
who had been a scribe in the days of Washington, 
and a chief governor in the land of Columbia, in times 
past ; a man whom the people esteemed for his vir- 
tue ; 

35 When he heard of their wickedness ; how, sa- 
vage-like, they had burnt the books which had been 
written by the wise men of the earth, and preserved 
from the beginning to that day ; 

36 In the goodness of his heart, he wrote unto the 
great Sanhedrim, when they were assembled together, 
saying : 

37 Since, like the barbarians of old, whose igno^ 
ranee might plead for them, the servants of the king- 
dom of Great Britain have laid waste your chief city» 
and made it a desolation, 

38 And have trampled upon science, mutilated the, 
monuments of art and industry, destroyed the archives 
of your nation, a-ad burnt your books with fire j

whatever in your judgment shall be the value thereof, 
t4iat will I accept.* 

40 I am well stricken in years, and must shortly 
sleep with my fathers ; but the last wish ol my heart 
shall be the welfare of my country. 

41 Now Thomas was a Philosopher, and a man of 
great learning, and he had abundance of books of all 
nations, and in all languages, even ten thousand vo- 
lumes. 

42 So the great Sanhedrim accepted the offer of 
Thomas, and they retain the books to this day. 

43 Now it came to pass, in the evening of the 
same day, on which the vandals of Britain set fire to 
the city, that the army of the king fled from the place ; 
far the air of Liberty is poison lo the followers of ty- 
rants. 

44 Moreover, they left some of their slain and 
v.-ouaded behind, for they were afraid of being caught 
in a snaje by the hushandmen of Columbia. 

45 So they went down to the river and gat into their 
vrssels from whence they came. 

45 In the meantime, the inhabitants of Alexandria,

48 And the ciiief captains of Britain agreed to the 
capituhition of the town, and to vouchsafe its protec- 
tion. 

49 But the people suiiored for thek foolisli cor.fi- 
dence j and no one \>\xkd ihan ; for it was of their 
©wn seeking. 

50 So it happened, after thfy had trusted to the 
faith of the servants of the king ; Gordon, a captain 
of the ships in the river Potowmac, came up against 

them before the town ; 

51 And took their merchant ships ; and compelled 
the people to open their store-houses, and put into the 
vessels their flour, even sixteen thousand barrels, and 
theh- wine, and their cotton, and a thousand hogsheads 
©fine sweet-scented plant.

14 Now it was in the morning, about the ninth hour, 
when IMacdonough beheld the fleet of Britain sailing 
boldly towards him. 

15 And it was so, that the vessels of Columbia 
>yere safely moored in the bay of Plattsburgh, where 
they waited the approach of the enemy: who were the 
■jtrongest in numbers, and in their engines of death.

iC However J when they were about a furlong offj 
Ihey cast their aRchors, and set themselves in battle ar-

17 Now the sound of the battle-dnim was heard 
along tlie lake, and the brave mariners shouted aloud 
for the fight. 

1 8 Then began their destroying engines to utter their 
veices, and it was like unto the voice of mighty thiin° 
ders. 

1 9 And the same hour, the armies on the shore be- 
gan the dreadfd battle with their roaring engines. 

20 So that on the land and on the waters the fire and 
smoke were abundant, and the noise thereof was tre- 
mendous beyond measure. 

21 And the battle waxed hot, and the vessels of 
Downie fought bravely against the vessels of Macdon- 
ough : 

22 Nevertheless, the Lord o-f hosts favored the men 
of Columbia, and they overcame the servants of th^e 
king. 

23 For in about the space of three hours, the va- 
lliiit Macdonough and his brave men, captured the 
wlioh fioet of Britain, save a few gun-boats, that made 
good their escape. 

24 Now the killed and wounded of the king's fleet, 
were an hundred ninety and four ; and Downie, the 
chief captain, was amongst the slain. 

2.3 Moreover, the mimber of the captives of tjie 
Kien of Britain was about four hundred. 

26 Now Macdonough was a good man, neither was 
^c Hiil of boasting and vuh>glory : he arrogated io

himself no praise on account of his success, but ascribed 
the victory to the pleasure of the Almighty. 

27 And as it is written, in the word of the Lord^^ 

Do UNTO ALL MEN AS YE VfOULD THEY SHOULD DO 

UNTO YOU, SO he took care of the prisoners, and em- 
ployed skilful physicians to bind up the wounds of the 
maimed. 5^ 

28 Then were the children of Columbia exceedingly 
rejoiced ; yea, their hearts were made glad ; and they 
praised Macdonough for his noble deeds. 

29 Moreover, the great Sanhedrim honored him % 
and a piece of land, which overlooketh the lake, was 
given unto him, for an inheritance ; 

30 That, in his old age, and when he was well 
stricken in years, he might remember with joy the 
strength of his youth, and smile upon the spot, wlieri* 
fleet to fleet, he triumphed over the enemies of free- 
dom ; 

31 And where his children's children might point,

die servants of the king. 

6 But Macomb kept the engines at work ; and 
Brooks, and llichards, and Smith, who were in the 
forts, displayed much valor, and caused the engines to 
vomit fire and smoke, and balls of heavy metal.

8 Notwithstanding this, they continued to cast their 

ballsj and their rockets^ and their bomb-shells, and their 
sharpnellsj with all their might. 

9 Now these sharpnells were unknown even to the 
children of Columbia, for they were lately invented by 
the wise men of Britain. 

10 But the people of Columbia trusted in the 
strength of their arms, more than in the strength of 
these shells, so they used them not. 

1 1 Nevertheless, the army of the king fought hard.,

were silenced by the brave band of Coluaibia.

the king, fled towards the strong hold of Montreal ; 
leaving their sick and wounded behind to the mercy of 
the men of Golumbia ; deslroyiag their provisions, which 
In their haste tliey could not carry away. 

13 Andtliemen of Columbia followed them a little 
WW? and slew some, and made many captives. 

14 Thus were the men of war of Britain conquered 
in the north, army agaiost army, fleet against fleet, and 
squadron against squadron. 

15 And the killed and wounded of the army of the 
king that day, were about a thousand men ; End about 
three hundred who were tired ot their bondage, left the 
service of the king,* and joined the banners of the great 
Sanhedrim.

OW when Ross and Cockburn returned from their 
burning and pillaging, and all the barbarities they com- 
mitted at Washington, the chief city, and the neighbor- 
hood thereof; 

2 Emboldened by the success of their unrighteous 
deeds, they gathered together their army and their navy, 
and essayed to go against the city of Baltimore, which 
lieth in the state of Maryland ; 

S That they might commit the like wickedness, in 
which they had taken so much pleasure at Hampton^ 
Havre-de-grace, an-d Washington. 

4 But they had a mightier place than Washington to 
go against ; foi* Baltimore is a great city, containing 
therein about fifty thousand souls, and the people had enr 
trenched it round about, and made it a strong place. 

5 So it came to pass, the next day after Macdonough 
had captured the fleet oi Britain, on lake Champlain, 
being the twelfth day of the niigith month,

called North Point, which lieth at the mouth of ^e river.

began to put their men of war upon the shore. 

7 And the number of their chosen fighting men. who 
were landed, were about eight thousand. 

8 And when they were all moved out of the boats, 
Ross, the chief captain, conducted them on towards the 
city. 

9 As they moved along their instruments of war glit- 
tered in the beams of the sun j and the waving of their 
3quadrons was like unto the troubled waters of the 

ocean. 

10 However, when they came to a place called 

Sear Creek, lo ! the army of Columbia met them in bat^ 
tie array. 

1 1 For, when the gallant young men of Baltimore 
heard the rumor, that the soldiers of Britain were com- 
ing upon them ; 

12 With the spirit of freemen, they grasped their 
7^ capons of war in their hands, and went out to meet 
thtm without fear ; and resolved to conquer or to die.* 

13 For well they knew, 'hat life would be a burthen 
to them, when their habitations were consumed with fire ; 
their parents slaughtered j and the innocence of their 
wives and sisters violated. 

14 Now the name of the chief captain of the army of 
Cohimbia was Samuel, whose sir-name was Smith :t 
a valiant man, who had fought in the days of Washington, 
and gained much honor.

years, and he had many brave captains under him ; 
even Strickei", and Stansbury, and Winder were with 
him. 

iG Now it was somewliat after the mid-day when, 
the engines of destruction began their roarinir noises : 

17 And the fire and smoke were vomited forth out 
of their mouths, so that tlie h'ght of the sun was hid- 
den by the means of th<; black clouds that filled the air. 

] 8 And their rockets, and all their instruments of 
death, which the sons of men have employed their un- 
derstandings to invent, were used abundantly. ' 

19 Kowtite battle\ waxed hot, and the gallant Sfrick- 
er, and liis brave men, fought hard : and it was a dread- 
ful fight, 

20 Inasmuch' as the slain and wounded of the king 
that day, were about four hundred ; and the loss of the 
men of Columbia M-as two hundred. 

21 Moreover, Ros^, the chief captain of the host of 
Britain, was amongst the slain ; a boy, who had accom- 
jr^anied Ids father to battle, had taken dreadful aim at 
Ross, with his rifle, a,nd killed him : 

22 And the people of Columbia grieved only be- 
cause it was not Cockburn the wicked, who h:i(i fallen ; 
for a man, whose name was O'Boyle, had offered live 
hundred pieces of silver for each of his ears.

Stiles were among tlie captains of the strong holds ; 
and were all faithful men. 

25 But it came to pass, the next day, when the men 
of Britain saw that the men of Columbia were well 
prepared for battle, that they were afraid to go against 
the strong holds. 

26 So in the middle of the night, which was dark 
and rainy, they departed from the place, and returned 
to their vessels, that they might escape the evil that was 
preparing for them. 

27 Moreover, tliey took the dead body of Ross, 
their chief captain, with them, and cast it into a vessel, 
filled with the strong waters of Jamaica ; 

28 That the instrument of their wickedness might 
fee preserved, and conveyed to the king, their masterj 
and be buried in his own count r}'. 

29 Now it came to pass, in the meantime, that 
Cochrane, and Cockburn the vdcked, the chief captain, 
of the mariners of the king, sailed up the river Petap- 
§co, towards the strong hold of Fort M'Lieircy, to as- 
sail it 

30 Now the strong hold of M'Henry lieth about fi& 
Uten furlongs from the cityj and the name of the chief 
captain thereof was Armistead, a man of courage : al- 
beit, he was sick. 

31 And when the strong vessels of the king drew 
aigh unto the fort, they cast their rockets and their 
bomb-shells into it plentifully, and strove hard to drive- 
the men of Columbia away.

32 But the gallant Arraistead let the destroying en- 
gines loose upon them without mercy ; and they cast 
out their thunders, winged with- death, among the ser- 
vants of the king. 

33 The loud groans of their wounded floated upon 
the waters, with an awful horror that shocked the ear 
of humanity.

could not prevail against the strong hold, he also depart-

OW the loud and frightful noise of war sounded 
tipon the bosom of the great deep ; and the shores 
of Columbia knew no peace. 

2 The dreadful clanger of arms rung upon the land, 
and echoed from the mountains ; and the groans of suffer- 
ing victims floated in the aii- of heaven. 

S But the Lord favored the people of Columbia, 
flmd their armies and their navy gained strength, and 
iprosperity was showered upon them : the voice of 
Var became familiar to those who where strangers to 
it inrtimes past, 

4 Now on the twenty-sixth day of the ninth month j be- 
ing in the thirty and ninth year of American ludepen^ 
rfencej 

5 It came to pass, that a certain private armeil ^c-

(5 Had cast her anchors in the haven of Fayal, an 
island in the sea, which lieth towards the rising sua, 
about two thousand miles from the laud of Columbia ; 

7 A place where, two score and tea years ago, there 
was a mighty earthquake j and where poisonous replil6.s 
never dwell. 

8 And it was about the dusk of the evening when 
Samuel saw a number of the strong vessels of Britain 
hemming him in ; so he drew nigh to the shore for 
safety, for the place was friendly to both powers. 

9 Nevertheless, the boats from the vessels of the king 
went against Samuel to take his vessel j but with 
his weapons of war he drove them oiTand slew numbers 
of them, so that they were glad to escape to their 
girong ships. 

10 However, they quickly returned with a greater 
number of boats, and about four hundred men ; and Sa- 
muel saw them, and prepared to meet them. 

1 1 The silver beams of the mcon danced upon the 
gently rolling waves of the ocean, and th.e sound oi 
tiie oar again broke the sweet silence of night. 

12 But, when they came nigh the vessel of Sanmel, 
the men of Columbia poured out destruction upoa them 
with a plentiful hand j 

13 Inasmuch as they were again compelled to de- 
part to their strong vessels with dreadful loss. 

14 However, about the dawning of the day, one of 
the strong vessels, called the Carnation, came against 
the vessel of Columbia, and let her destroying engines 
ioose with great fury. 

15 Now Lloyd, v.ho commanded the Plantagenet 



18« HISTORIC AX, 

was the chief captain of the kjng, in the pla<le 5 and he 
violated the law of nations. . 

16 So, when Samuel saw that the whole fleet of 
Britain were beni on destroyin-^ his vessel, in defiance 
of the plighted honor of nations, he ordered her to be 
sunk. 

17 After which he and his brave mariners deserted 
her, and went upon the shore ; and the servants of the 
king came and burnt her with fire in the neutral port of 
Fajal. 

18 Nevertlieless, they received the reward of their 
unrighteousness, for much damage was done to their 
vessels, and their slain and wounded were tv/o hundred 
two score and ten. 

19 Of the people of Columbia two only were slain 
,and seven maimed ! ! 

20 And the valiant deeds of Samuel gained him a 
name among .; the brave men of Columbia. 

21 Now, in the same month, the Scorpion and the 
Tigress, two fighting vessels of Columbia, on lake Hu- 
ron, were captured by the ni'-n of Britain. 

22 Likewise, about tills tim.e, there were numerous 
other evils that beil-l ilie sons of Columbia ; 

23 Ina^3.auch as a brave captain, whose sir-name wcis 
Morris, w?^ jed to consume his ship with fire, 
lest she sii^jid fall into the hands of the enemy 5 and 
she was called the Adams.* 

24 Now this was at a place called Castine, which 
was forcibly occupied by the strong ships of Britain,

over, it became a watering place for the servants of the 
king. 

25 But wlien James, the chief governor, and the 
great Sanhedrim, knew thereof, they sent word to the 
governor, ami offered him soldiers to drive them from 
the borders of Columbia ; 

26 But. lo ! the governor, even Caleb the Strong, 
refused his aid, for he was afraid of the wrath of the 
king of Britain.* 

27 (Now Caleb, in the Hebrew tongue, signifieth a 
dog 5 but, verily, this dog was faithless.) 

28 Moreover, it came to pass, about the same time» 
that the strong hold of Fort Boyer, being at a place 
called Mobile-point, was attacked by the strong ships 
of Britain. 

2D Now Mobile had lately been the head quarlere 
and the resting-place of the army of Jackson tke 
brave ; 

30 But the enemies of Columbia had become tumal- 
tuous at a place called by the Spaniards, Pensacola, 
whither he had departed to quell them ; 

31 So that the fort was defended hy only a handfai 
of men, commanded by the gallant Lawrence. 

32 And the names of the vessels of Viiig, that 
assailed the fort, were the Hermes, the ChecfOn, and 
the Sophie, besides other fighting vessels ; which open- 
ed their fires upon the strong hold. 

33 Nevertheless, Lawrence was not dismayed, af-.

34 So when Lawrence let his engines of death 
loose upon them, and had sliowered the whizzing balls 
amongst tliem, for about tlie space of tliree hours, they 
iled. 

Sd And the slaughter on board the ships was dread- 
ful ; and about three hundred of the men of Britain- 
were slain, and tlie Hermes was blown out of the wa- 
ter into tlie air with an awful noise. 

S6 The loss of the people of Columbia that day, 
was four slain and five maimed. 

37 About this time a band of sea-robbers and pi- 
rates, who had established themselves upon the island 
of Barrataria, were committing great wickedness and 
depredations 5 and were ready to assist the men of 
Britain. 

38 But a valiant man, called Daniel, sir-named 
Patterson, went against them with his 'small fighting 
vessels,! and scattered them abroad^ and took their 
vessels, and destroyed their petty establishment of sea- 
robbery. 

39 Now it came to pass, when Jackson heard that

r>truction. 

16 And Samuel, a philosopher, sir-named Mitch eL 
a citizen of New-York, was one of the commissioners ; 
ulso, Rutgers, and Mornis, and Wolcot, and Dearbornj 
were other commissioners ; and they all gave their ser^ 
Tices freely for the good of their country. 
.^17 Now she was equipped with thirty of the engines 
cf destruction ; and the weight of a ball that they vom- 
ited forth was about a thousand shekels. 

18 And, when the movement of the frigate was seen 
©n the river, she was as a strong floating battery upon the 
waters, terrible as death. 

19 And the length thereof was about an hundred cii* 
bits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : 

20 Moreovei^ as they had no gophar-wood, they 
built the vessel partly the locust-tree, and partly of 
the majestic oak that i »ishe5 in the extensive forests 
of Columbia. 

21 But it came to pass, when the wise men and the 
people of Britain heard of this steam frigate, they were; 
seized with astonishment and fright ; inasmuch as it be* 
came a monster in their imaginations. 

22 And they spake concerning it, saying, Lo ! the 
length of this wonder of ^e world, which hath been in- 
vented by these cunning Yankees, is about two hundred 
«ubits, and the breadth thereof an hundred thirty and 
jive cubits ; 

23 The number of her destroying engines is very 
great ; and the weight of a ball which she vomiteth 
forth, is about a thousand live huadrtd two score^aft^

24 Moreover, said they, she is prepared to cast 
ibrth scalding water in showers, upon the servantvs of 
the king, which will deform their countenances and 
spoil their beauty ; 

25 Likewise, they have prepared lier with two-edged 
gwords, v/hicii, by means of the steam of ike vessel, 
issue like liglitning out of >.er sides. 

26 And now, also, tlie cunning and witchcraft of 
these Yanliees, these sons of Belial, the5.e chikhren of 
Beelzebub, have invented another instrument of de- 
struction, more subtile than all the rest : 

27 Yea, these are mighty evil things, and they are 
failed torpedoes, which may be said to signify sleeping 
devils ; which come^ as a thief in the ni.^jht, to destroy 
the servants of the king ; and v/ere coainved by thav 
arch fiend, whose name was ? It on 

28 Now these wouderiV.! terpen, ^s were made partly 
©f brass and partly of iron, and were cunningly con- 
trived with cuiious works, like unto a clock j and as'M 
were a large ball* 

29 And, after they ^ere prepared, and a grcftt 
quantity of the black dust put therein, they were le* 
down into the water, nigh unto the strong ships, with 
intent to destroy them ; 

SO And it was so, that when they strnck against the 
bottom of the ship, the black dust in the torpedo 
would catch fire, and burst forth with tremendous roar, 
casting the vessel out of the waters and bursting her 
in twain. 

31 New these torpedoes were brought into practice 
^htfing the war, although the war ceased before they di^ 



196 HISTORICAL 

that dcstfLrction to the enemies of Columbia, for wiiicfe. 
they were intended. 

3^ However, a certain man of courage and enter- 
prize, whose name was Mix, prepared one of the 
torpedoes, and put it into the waters of the deep, at 
ii place called Lyn-IIaven Bay, at the mouth of the 
great bay of Cliesapeake, nigh unto the town of Nor- 
folk, in the state of Virginia 5 

33 And it moved towards a strong sliip of Brhaiiv, 
called the plantagenet, after one o( the former princtL. 
of Eiidaiid ; but a» accident happened a little befciie 
if reached the vessel, and burst it asunder in tlie waters, 
wiih a tremendous noise j * 

34 And spouted ih.Q water up into the air, as doth 
tl-.c mighty whale, and the sound thereof was, as iti 
were tlie voice of thunder ; ? 

35 And the servants of the king were frightened 
horribly by the means thereof- after which they trem- 
bled at the name torpedo !— and were obliged to guard 
dicir vessels in the night, and put '^ double v/atch upoa 
ihrm ; 

'i S6 Moreover, they condemned this mode of v/arfHre^ 
,^»\iing : Vcril}'-, this is a foul fasiiion of fighting ; ii:as- 
jnuch as by your cunning ye Yaid^ees take the advan- 
eage of us ; and the thir*g is new^ unto us. 

37 But they had wilfully forgotten, that in the life 
time of Fulton, they bad oiTeied him forty thousand" 
pieces of gold, if he would bring ttiese torpedoes into 
practice in their own country, that they might use them 
against the Gauls,* with wnom they waned outinu-

iaithless to Fulton, and so he did it not for them. 
' 38 Moreover, it came to pass, that a certain man, a 
pilot, even Joshua, sir-namt^d Penny, became a victim 
of thoi»- ■jpite, because he attempted to p-o r.crainst them 
with the torpedoes to drive them out of the waters of 
Cohimbia. 

39 Now Joshua lived at a place called East Hamp- 
ton, being at the east end of Long Island, near Gard- 
ner's Island, opposite Netv London. 

40 And the men of Britai . ^an-ie to his house in the 
night, and stole him away, even out of his bed, and car- 
ried him on board a vessel of the kin^, called the Ra- 
milies, from whence he was conveyed to Halifax, in the 
province 6lR|s^ova Scotia. 

4 Now \yhile Joshua remained in the dungeons ot 
the king he was treated vs^ith the inhospitality of barba- 
rian? ; moreover, they strove to lead b-im astray : but 
he proved faithful to his God and to his country ; for 
he had known the wickedness of Britain in times 
past.*

months, after v/hich they suffered him to go to his owa

OW, as good sometimes cometh out of evil, so 
the people of ISew-York, a great city, which licih at 
the mouth of the river Hudson, nigh the sea coast, and 
coutainetli more than an hundred thousand souls,

mhted by the servants of the king, to tlie south and 
round about, began to besur theraselvesj and prepare 
for the dangers with which they were likely to be en- 
compassed : 

3 So it came to pass, that the liusbandmen from the 
surrounding country gathered together, and pitched 
their tents hard by the ciry. 

4 And the number that came to the defence of the 
place was about thirty thousand valiant m.en ; moreover 
there were about five thousand husbandmen froa^ tht^ 
state of Ne\y- Jersey,*

ihe^ were encamped partly at Pauies Hook, and part- 
ly at a place called tlie Narrows, which lieth to the 
.ioulh of the city about an hundred furlongs, where the 
destroying engines were ])l3ced in muhitudes. 

G And when the term of the ehgagement of these 
men of Jersey expired, they grieved only that their 
lime was spent for nought ; for they were ready and 
well prepared to meet the servants of the king. 

7 Neverth"cless, it was so that the freemen who came 
to tiie defence of the city, built strong holds and forts, 
aiid raised up fortifications in abundance, inasmuch as 
tlie whole phice was as it were one camp.

18 Moreover, as they passed along up the Hudson^ 
towards the heights of Haerlenij the fair daughters of 
Coiumbia, with hearts glowing with patriotism, waved 
their lily hands in token of applause. 

19 Likewise, bands of men came from the neigh- 
bourhood round about ; even from Newark, and Pat- 
terson, and Failles Hook, which lie in the state of New- 
Jersey. 

20 Tliey had also captains appointed over their

even from the town of Patterson, where the wonderful 
waterfalls pour headlong over the rocky m(^|^ains, re-

24 Notwithstanding, the haughty captains of the 
ghips of Britain would send in their boats to rob !he 
aaarket-men and the fishermen ; liowbeit, they were 
sometimes entrapped. 

25 For it cao:ie to pass, upon ascertain day, that the 
Poictiers, a mighty ship of the king, lying at a place 
called Sandy- Hook, sent out one of her tenders, even

the Yankee, under the direction of a clilef captain

Strong vessel called the Constitution, commanded by

of the king, and compelled them both, in the space of 
forty minutes, to strike the red cross of Britain to the 
stars of Columbia. 

19 And the siain ^nd wounded of the king's ships

24 However, ihe battle was a bloody one, and the 
vessels kept their engines of destruction fiercely in 
motion, for about the space of half an hour before 
the flag of Britain was lowered to the stripes of Colum-

25 And the slaughter was great ; for there fell of 
the men of Britain two score and one : but the slain of 
Columbia was only one, and the maimed were eleven. 

26 And Biddle was honored greatly for his cou-

27 But this was the last sea-fight of importance, be-

28 Now about this time the navy of Columbia had 
increased more than fourfold, and the fame thereof had

OW, when the lords and the counsellors, and the 
wise men of Britain, heard of all the tribulations that 
befel them in the land of Columbia, they were troubled 
in their minds. 

2 And as they had made what they called a demon- 
stration at Baltimore, they bethought themselves of ma- 
king another demonstration in the south. 

3 (Now the true signification, in the vernacular 
tongue, of the word demonstration, had slways been 
familiar to the children of Columbia j but the new in- 
terpretation, althoit^h it wounded the pride of Britain, 
tickled the sons of Columbia ; for, as the world must 
think to this day, so they could only construe it, an oc- 
ular demonstration of British folly.) 

4 So it came to pass, that they gathered together 
their army and their navy, even two score and ten 
figliiing vessels, carrying therein about twenty thousand 
men of war; and the name of the chief captain of the 
navy was Cochrane; and the chief captains of the 
arm^r were Fakenhan?, Gibbs, and Keane,

set fire to, and blo^ya up, by tiie heated balls of the

20 On the next dfi}^, the whole iiosc of Britain gather-

against the strong hold of Jackson. 

21 But Jackson let tlie destroying engines loose upon 
the servants of Britain, and compell-ed them to return 
to their encampments with great loss, even an hundred 
and two score. 

22 Nevertheless^, on the first day of the first month 
of the eighteen hundred and fifteenth year, the men of 
war of Britain came again, and strove to dislodge the 
army of Jackson ; but again they were deceived, and 
lost about an hundred men. 

23 At this time there arrived to the aid of Jackson 
about two tliousand five hundred valiant men, from the 
backs-woods of Kentucky. 

24 Disappointed in their expectations, and failing in 
their attempts to discomfit the army of Columbia, the 
captains and the host of Britain arrayed themselves in 
their might to go against the hold of Jackson v/ith their 

whole fOKGQ.

defences upon the banks of the river, likewise let his

king. 

-^20 And the men of Britain strove to scale the ram-

husbandmen drove them back with great slaughter.

"Peace. 



j\ OW after the fleet of Britain had departed from 
New-Orleans in dismay, they committed many other 
depredations of a petty nature. 

2 In the mean time, Cockburn, the wicked, was busi« 
ly employed in what his heart delighted ; inasmuch as 
he carried the men of Britain against the borders of 
South Carolina and Georgia, and continued his system 
of robbery. 

3 And here, with the strong ships of Britain, he cap- 
tured a town called St. Marys, in the state of Georgia 
and, among other evils, he stole away the sable sons of 
Ethiopia. 

4 And conveyed them to the island of Bermuda, 
of which the king had made him chief governor, and 
sold them, after promising them liberty and free- 
dom. 

5 However, it came to pass about this time, that 
the news of peace being made between the nations arri- 
ved in tlie land of CoIuraljJa, 

6 For it had happened that the great Sanhedrim in 
ili'Ar uii Jom, had sent out lienry, sirnamed Clay, and 



222 HISTOBICAL. 

Russel, two wise men, called, in the vernacular tongue^ 
commissioners, to join themselves with Bayard and 
Gallatin, who were sent before them, to try and make 
peace : 

7 For the voice of the people of Columbia had spo- 
ken peace from the beginning ; they wished war might 
cease, and that the breach between the nations might be 
bealed. 

8 In the mean time the king sent some of his wise 
men to meet the wise men of Columbia, at a place 
called Ghent, a town a great way off, in the country of 
FJanders ; 

9 For it came to pa«s, that the generous mediation 
offered by the emperor of Russia was refused by the 
council of Britain, who had not yielded to the voice of . 
accommodation. . 

10 So, when the ministers of the two nations were 
tnet, they communed a long time with one another, 

"touching the matter ; 

11 But the ministers of Britain raised up difficul- 
ties, and demanded certain foolish terms, which, in the 
Latin tongue, were written sine. qua non, and which 
being translated into the Yankee tongue, might be said 
te mean neck or nothing. 

12 Nevertheless, in process of time, the wise mea 
cf Britain waved tl»eir demands, and agreed to the 
sine qua nan given them by the commissioners of Co- 
Kimbia,. 

13 So a treaty &( peace was made and signed by the 
commissioners of both parties, on the twenty and 
il)wrth day of the twelfth month, of the one thousand 
.si- ht hundred and Jourteenth year oi the christian ^/^^ 



READER. . 225 

14 And the treaty was sent to England, and con- 
firmed by the Prince Regent, on tl^e twerfty-eigth day 
of the same month ; for he was tired of the war, and 
saw no hopes of conquering the sons of liberty. 

15 After which it was sent from Britain, across the 
the mighty deep, about three thousand miles, to receive 
the sanction of the free people of Columbia, 

16^ And the great Sanhedrim of the people examined 
the treaty, and it was accepted and confi>"med by tlieu) 
on the seventeenth day of tiic second month, in tlie 
eighteen hundred and fifteenth year. 

17 After which it was ratified and signed with the 
Imnd- writing of James, the chief governor of the land 
of Columbia, and published to the world. 

18 Thus was a stop put to the shedding of human 
blood ; and the noise of the destroying engines sunk 
down into silence, and every man returned to his awn^ 
home in peace. 

19 Now when it w^as known for a certainty that 
peace was made between the nations, the people^ 
throughout the land were rejoiced beyond measure. - 

20 And when the news thereof was spread abroad^ 
the temples of the Lord were opened,, and the people 
\^( Columbia praised God for his goodness ; yea, they 
thanked him that he had strengthened their arms, and 
delivered theiii from the paw of the Iron. 

21 Thus did the children of Columbia praise the 
Lord in the strength of their youth, and in the days 
of their p-rosperity ; not waiting tiU the cold and palsied 
hand of age had made them feeble, and robbed their 
prayers of half their virtue. 

2% Henceforth may the nations of the ec^rth learn

wisdom : then shall peace become triumphant, and tTie 
people of Columbia be at rest ; 

23 And, as it is written, their swords may bs beaten 
into ploughshares, and their spears turned into pruning- 
hooks. 

24 Bin, nevertheless, if this war, like all otiier warsv 
}>rou[^dit evil upon the sons of men, it demonstrated l 
the worlil, tiiat tlie people of Columbia wc-rc pihle to

2(3 Now the gladness of tlie hearts of the people 
C'f Cckuiibia at the sound of peace, was extravagant , 
inasmuch as it caused them to let loose their destroying 
engines, that were now become harmless, and set in mo- 
tion ilieir loud pealing bells, that sounded along tlie 
spleuditl arch of heaven. 

J/ ?tloreover, they made great tires and illumina-

hey called the Bashaw, had suffered like evils to be 

ijoiie by the British in his dominions wliich had been 
permitted by the Bey of Tunis.

thirty thousand pieces of silver, but at first t!:e Ba^ 
shaw refused to pay it. 

36 However, when he saw the strong ships of Co- 
lumbia were about to destroy the town, he paid th^e^ 
money, save a little, which he was unable to get, and 
for which Decatur compelled him to release ten captives 
of other nations, whom he held in bondage. 

37 Thus did Decatur, and his brave men in the san>e^

banners of Columbia. 

38 Now, having accomplished the object of his ex-

€o/nmodore Bct!:iJ)ridge — Lird ExinoiitPs Ex^^edi- 
iion against Al'^icrs. 



N the mean time, it had come to pass, that lest the 
fieet of Decatui should not be sufficient, the great San- 
hedrim sent out after him another strong fieet, C'^m- 
maiidcd by the valiant Bainbridge. 

2 But, io ! when his fleet arrived there, the peace 
kad been made, and an end put to the war by the Seet 
of Decatur: so, after sailing round about the coast, 
Bambridge returned home again with the fieet of Co- 
lumbia. 

S Now it came to pass, after Decatur had returned 
in triumph to the land of Columbia, tiiat the lords and 
the counsellors of Britain became jealous of the fame 
of Columbia, which she had gained in the east, in re- 
leasing her people from slavery, as well as those of 
other nations. 

4 ™Ioreover, the barbarians committed depredations 
against the people of Britair, neither did tliey regard 
their royal cross, as they did the stars of Columbia. 

5 So the king fitted out a mighty fieet to go against 
themj and the name of the chief captain thereof was 



Telle -v, to 'rt^hom the king of Britain had given a f$-'» 
mame, and called him lord Ex.moutli. 

Accordingly, as thcif movements were slow, in 
the f ) irt;i montli of tho ove tho'isand eight hundred and 
r^ixt^vivh t/ear of tbe Cliristian era, the nnghty fleet of 
Britaia w^^ighed anchor, and shortly arrived before thie 
cify of Algiers, as the fieet of Golumbia had donfe 
many months before thern. 

7 And it was so, tiiat the chief captain of Britain, 
"in the nanie of the king his master, demanded of the 
Jjf^'y. the men of Britain, whom he held as slaves, and 
also those of other nations. 

8 Bat thf Dey refuserl. saying, Ye shall pay unto ni€ 
five hundred pieces of silver for every slave j then wit! 
I release them, and they shall be free. 

' 9 Arid Exraouth, the lord of Britain, yielded to the 
pro; ■ rilions of the barbarians, and accordingly gave 
iinto tl-.cm the money, even more than twenty horsed 
could draw ; 

10 For the number of Christian slaves which Ex- 
mouth bought of the barbarians, was about live hu8« 
drcd. 

1 1 Therefore, the fleet of Britain succeeded not, af 
did the fleet of DecatuF.* 



* Lord Exmouth nas since, in a second expedition^ 
succeeded in releasing all Christian captives covfned 
in Algiers, and in obtainin;r the ransom money (to a 
very cousidc-ahle amount ) icJiicli ih^ T)py had pr6'- 
viov^ly received from England and Naj^ksl^ 



12 "71uis, in tills thiniTj did the lortk of Britain 
strive to snatch the iaureJ from the brow of Colum- 
bia • 

IS Biit her valiant sons had entwined the wreath of 
glory ; and the scribes of tliis day shall record it, in 
«¥er-iiYicg characters, on the pyramid of fame.
