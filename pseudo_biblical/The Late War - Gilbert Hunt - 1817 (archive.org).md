true ; they are recent, being within the recoilecuon

5 The facts described are related in so clear and 
concise a way as without njuch eflbri on the part 
of the pupil, will easily fasten themselves on his 
memory. 

These arc some amongstother reasons wLich have 
induced the author to recommend his liule work to 
Teachers of youth throughout the United Stales, as 
veil as to fathers of families, and he does it the con- 
fident hope that it will prove useful in accelerating 
the progress of knowledge, and in awakening and 
cherishing in the minds of his young rounirymen 
those principles of virtue with which he has been 
.7^ Careful that it should be interwoven. 

Having received the universal approbation of men 
of judgment, he only thinks it necessary to give the 
following letters from Dr. S. L. Miichel, and Mr. 
Picket. \ 

O. J. HUNT. 



J^cW'York^ June \%y ISIT, 
Sir, 

I had noticed your work on the late war long 
before I had the pleasure of your acquaintance. It 
seems to be a plain and popular mode of exhibiting 
the transactions of which it treats. 

One of the defects in the literature of oiir country 
is that of good historians. 3 hat class of our citi- 
zens which is called to act, shows unparalleled at- 
chievcmeni and enterprize The other sections, to 
whom is allotted the business of narrating and re- 
cording events, are not so far advanced, the reason 
is evident ; there must be deeds to describe and per- 
petuate, before there can be historians. In process 
of lime, writers duly qualified, will make their ap- 
pearance 

Your Chronicle of events deserves to be men- 
tioned in the livt of useful publications. It will an-* 
Bwer as a book to begin with ; or it m;iy serve as a 
document of constant and ready reference. The re*

at the same time, to respect their country and its ia-

It seems to me one of the best attempts to imitate 
the biblical style ; and if the perwsal of it can in- 
duce young persons to relish and love the sacred 
books, whose language you have imitated, it will be 
the strongest of all recommendations.

OW it came to pass, in the one ttiousand eight 

hiitulred and twelfth year of the christian era, and in 
the thirty and sixth year after the people of the pro- 
vinces of Columbia had decUred themselves a free 
and independent nation ; 

2 That in the sixth month of the san e year, on the 
first day of the month, the chief Governor, whom the 
people had chosen to rule over the land of Columbia; 

3 Even Jambs, whose sir-name was Madisov, 
delivered a written paper* to the Great SANHKDHiut 
of the people, who \^ere assembled together^ 

4 And the name of the city where the peop4s;wer£, . 
gathered together was called after the name of tl||&. 
chief captain of the land of Columbia, whose fe«le^* 
cxtendeth to the uttermost parts of the earth ; albeit, 
he had slept with his fathers.

5 Nevertheless, the pe.ople loved him, forasmucti 
ks he wrought their deliverance from the yoke of 
tyranny in times past: so they called the city WAbS" 

IHOTON. 

6 Now* when the written paper was received, the 
doors of the chambers of the Great Sanhedrim were 
ofosed, and a seal was put upon every man's mouth. 

y And the counsellors of the naiion, and the wise 
men thereof, ordered the written paper which James 
bad delivered unto them to be read aloud } and the in- 
terpretation thereof was in this wise ; 

8 Lo ! the lords and the princes of the kingdom of 
Britain, in the fulness of their pride and power, have 
trampled upon tlie altar of Liberty, anci violated the 
sanctuary thereof ; ;. --^ . 

9 Inasmdch as they hearkened not unto the voice of 
.moderation, when the cry of the people of Columbia 
■was. Peace ! peace ! 

10 Inasmuch as they permitted not the tall ships of 
Columbia to sail in ^eace on the waters of the mighty 
dtep; saying in their hearts, Of these will we m;^kc 
spoil, and they shall be given unto the king. 

1 1 Inasmuch as they robbed the ships of Columbia 
of the' strong men that wrought therein, and took 
tliem for their own use, even as a man taketh his ox 
or his ass. - ' 

* 12 Inasmuch as they kept the men stolen from the 
ships of ('oliimbia ii. bondage many years, and caused 
them to iight the baul.es of the king, even agaiuisi their 
own;|)i»ethren ! neiilier gave tliey unto them silver op 
l^ld, 1^ut many stripes.. 

' 13 Now the men of CclumUia were not like unto 
Hie men <»f Britain j for their bucks were not harUtn- 
ed unto the whip, as were llie servants of the king ; 
therefore they murmured) and their murniuriujj^

U Moreover, the Council of Britain sent ffirth a 
Decree to all the nations of the earth, sealed with the 
signet of the Pvjnce Regent, who gov45rnedthe nation 
in the name of the king, his father ; for, io ! the king 
was possessed of an evil spirit, and his son reigned in 

his stead*..' ... ■,...»■ ■•■.'.•• .;-^t.^.,, ''ii^C^",- 

15 Now this Decree of the Council of Britain was 
a grievous tking, inasmuch as it permitted net tho^e 
who dealt in merchandize to go whithersoever they 
chose, and to trade freely with all parts of the earthy 

16 And it fell hard upon the people of Columbia j 
for the king said unto them, Ye shall come with yvUi* 
vessels unto me and pay tribute, then may ye depart t^ 
another country. 

17 Now these things pleased the pirates and the 
cruisers of ilriiain mightily, because it permitte.4 
them to rob the commerce of Columbia with impunity, 

18 Furthermore, have not the servants of the king 
leagued with the savages of the wilderness, and giv^ 
unto tUeni silver and gold, and placed the destroying 
engines in their hands ? ..■ . ', ^. •<,';, « 

19 Thereby stirring up the spirit of Satan within 
them, that they might spill the blood of the people of 
Columbia ; even the blood of our old men, our wives, 
and our little ones ! v 

20 Thus had Britain, in her heart, commenced WaP 
against the'pcople of Columbia whilst they cried aloud 
for peace : and when she smote them on tlic one cheek 
they turned unto her the other also. 

21 Now, therefore, shall we, the indepeiwfeni peo» 
pic ofColuHibia, sit down silently, as slaves, iind bow 
tne neck to Britain ? ■ 

22 Or, shall we, like ouv .jR»re fathers, nobly as<)ert 
our rights, aid defend that Lioi-RrY and iNSUFflUSPk

ceriain wise men from among 



>W, when there was aq end made of reading the 
paper which James had written, the Sanhedrim com* 
Inuned one with another touching the matter : 

3 And they chose 
Miem to deliberate thereon. 

3 And they commanded them to go forth from their 
presence) for thitt purpose, and return again on the 
tfiird day of the same month. 

4 Now» when the third day arrived, at the eleventh 
hour of the day, they came forth and presented them- 
selves before the Great Sanhedrim of the people. 

5 And the chief of the wise men, whom they had 
chosen, opened his mouth and spake unto them after 
this manner : 

6 Behold 1 day and night have we meditated upoil 
the words which James hath delivered, and we arc 
-weary withal, for in our hiearts we desired peace. 

7 But the wickedness of the kingdom of Great- 
Britain^ and the cruelty of the princes thereof, to- 
-wards the peaceable inhabitants of the land of Colum- 
biu, may be likened unto the fierce lion, when he put* 
teth his paw upon the innocent lamb to devour him. 

8 Nevertheless, the lamb shall not be slain ; for the 
Lord shall be his deliverer. 

9 And if, peradventure, the people of Columbia go 
not out to battle against the king, then will the mani- 
fold N*rong8 comm'tted against them be increased ten- 
ibld. and they shall be as a mock and a bye- word 
among kll nations.

1 1 Therefore, say we unto you, Gird on your swords 
and go forth to battle against the king ; even against 
the strong powers of Britain ; and the Lord Qodof 
Hosts be with you. . , 

13 Now when thie great Sanhedrim of the people 
beard those things which the wise men had uttered* 
they pondered them in their minds many days, and 
weighed them well ; 

IS Even until the seventeenth day of the month 
pondered they in secret concerning the matter. 

j4 And it was so, that on the next day they sent 
forth a Da^cRBE, making WAR upon the kingdom qf 
Great Britain, and upon the sf rya^ts, and ujpon jtfap 
slaves thereof , * v^ ^

And it came to pass, that when the princes and the 
lords and the counsellors of Britain saw the Decree, 
their wrath was kindled, and their hearts were ready 
to burst with indignation. ^' 

2 For, verily, said they, this insult hath overflowed 
the cup of our patience ; and now will we chastise the 
impudence bf these Yankees, and the people of Co- 
lumLiasirall bow before the kinij.

off the governors of the east) and' he was led astray by 
the wickedness thereof, even Caied the Strong. 

19 Now Caleb, which in the Cherokee tongue, sig- 
niiieth an ass, liked not the decree of the g^eat San* 
hedritni inlaismuch as he favored the king; of Britain; 

30 And, though willing to become a beast of burden, 
yet would he not move oh account of his very great 
stupidity^ '' :,::. -^ht^K^^^'-- ' u i«'.f.%; .. >"; 

21 And he said unto the captains of the hosts of the' 
state over which he prcbided,'Lo! it seemeth not meet 
unto me that ye go forth to battle against the king* 

22 For, lo ! are not the fighting men of Britain, in 
multitude, as the sand on the sea shore? and shall we 
prevail against them ? 

23 Are not the mighty ships of the king spread over 
the whole face of the waters ? Is not Brituii^ the ^* bul" 
vark of our religion ?*' 

24 Therefore, I command that ye go not out to bat- 
tle, but every man remain in his own house. ' 

25 And all the governors of the east listened utito 
the voice of Caleb. 

26 Moreover, the angel of the Lord whispered in- 
t%the ear of Caleb, and spake unto him, saying, 

2f If, peradventure, thou dost refuse to obey the- 
laws of the land, the thing will not be pleasitnt in the' 
sight of the Lord ; 

28 Inasmuch as it may cause the people to rise up 
•ne against another, and spill the blood of their own- 
children ; 

29 And the time of warfare will be lengthened oUt, 
and the bfood of thousands will be upon thine head. 

30 And Satan spake, and said unio Caleb, Fear not ; 
for if thou wilt forsake thy country, and throw off the 
paltrysubterfuge of Columbian LiBERTt, and defy 
the councils of tb« great Sanhedrim,

32 Now the smooth words of Satan tickled Caleb 
mightily, and he barkened unto the counsel of the 
wieked one : , ' .„ , . • 

33 P'or the good counsel given unto him was as wa- 
ter thrown upon a rock. 

34 But when the chief governor and the great San- 
hedrim of the people saw the wickedness of Caleb, 
their hearts -were moved with pity towards 'him and 
his followers : yea, even those who had made a con- 
vention at the little town of Hartford. 

35 Neither doth the scribe desire to dwell upon the 
wickedness \^hiGh came into the village of Hartford,

2 Now it came to pass, that a certain man, whose sir- 
name was Henry, came before James, the chief i^o- 
vernor, and opened his mouth, and spake unto him 

3 Lo ! if thou will give unto me two score and ten 
thousand pieces of silver, then will I unfold unto thee 
the witchcraft of Britain, that tliereby thy nauon may 
not be caught in her snares. 

4 And James said unto him, Verily, for the good 
of my country I will do this thing. 

5 And immediately the man Henry opened his 
mouth, a second time, and said, 

6 Lo • the lords aud counsellors of Britain have 
made a covenant with me, and have promised me 
many pieces of gold if I would make a league with the 
provinces of the east that they might favour the kin?? • 
and long and faithfully have I laboured in their cause'. 

7 But they deceived me, even as they would de^ 
ceive the people of Columbia ; for their promises are 
as the idle wind that passeth by, which no man re- 
gardcth. 

8 And, when he had gotten the silver into his own 
hands he departed to the land of the Gaiils, where he 
reniMneth even until this day.

[inasmuch as it put them upon the watch, and they / 
guarded themselves against the evil accordingly. 

10 He that longeth after the interpretation of the 
deeds of Henry, let him go and hiake inquiry of those 
who acted with him— »the ministers of the Hartford 
Convention. 

1 1 Now, there was a certain hypocrite whose name 
was Elijah, and he was a false prophet in the cast; ' 
and he led astray those of little undc;rstanding : more-' 
over, he was an hireling, ai^d preached for the sake of 
filthy lucre. z , ■ . * 

12 And he rose up and called himself a preacher 
of the gospel, and his words were smooth, and the peo* 
pie marvelled at him ; 

13 But he profaned the temple of the Lord, and he' 
strove to lead his disciples into the wrong way. 

14 And many wise men turned their backs against 
him ; nevertheless, he repented not of his sins unto 
this day. 

15 Neither did the people, as Darius the Mede did 
xinto the prophet Daniel, cast him into the den of 
lions, that they might see whether the royal beasts 
would disdain to devour him. . V * 

16 But they were rejoiced that power was not giv 
en unto him to command fire to come down from hea-

la strong ship of the United States, called the Pre.',:-

was Crane, tarnished not his honor thereby. 

14 And the nanve of the vessel of the United States 
was called JVaulilus.

Now it came to pass, on the nineteenth day of the 
eighth month, that one of the tall ships of Columbia, 
called the Constitution, commanded by Isaac, whose 
sir-name was Hull, 

•^ 2 Having spread her white wings on the bosom of 
the mighty deep, beheld from afar one of the fighting 
ships of Britciin bearing the royal cross. 

S And the name of the ship was called^ in the lan^ 
guage of the French, Guerriere,* which signifieth a 
warrior, and Dacres was the captain thereof. 

4 Now when Dacres beheld the ship of Columbia 
his eyes sparkled with joy, for he had defied the vesseU 
of Columbia. 

5 And he spake unto his officers and his men that

10 And he put the army in battle array, in a ralley, 
and moved up towards the strong hold ; and Brock was 
the chief captain of the host of Britain. 

1 1 And from their strong hold they shot, with their 
mischievous engines, balls of lead in abundance ; and it 
was as a shower of hail upon the people or Columbia ; 

12 B'or there was no turning to the right hand nor 
to the left for safety. 

1 3 And Solomon and his men fought hard ; and they 
rushed into the hottest of the battle. 

14 And a captain of the United States^ whose name 
was Chrystie, followed close after thern^ with a chosen 
band of brave men. 

15 So they pushed forward to the strong hold, and 
uroye the men of Britain before them like sheep, and 
smote them hip and thigh, with great slaughter ; and 
J3rock, their chief captain, was among the slain. 

16 And Chrystie, and the valiant Wool, and Ogil- 
vle, and the host of Columbia, gat into the hold, and 
the army of the king fled : and Chrystie was wounded 
in the palm of his band. 

17 But Solomon was sorely wounded, so that his 
i^ength failed him, and he went not into the hold. 

1 8 And that day there fell of the servants of the king 
many valiant men, even these whe were called Invin- 
cibles, and had gained great honour in Egypt. 

19 Nevertheless, the same day a mighty host of sa-

lis terrible as the wild tyger, and their numbers as the 
Itrees of the forest.

[will be as sheep going to the slaughter ; and ye shall

were about four score.

hulf a score : howbcit, there was much damage done 
to both vessels. 

1 1 Nevertheless, about this time, a mit^hty ship of 
Britain, culled the Puictiers, came upon the vessels, 
which were in a defenceless situ:ition, and took them 
both, and commanded them to go to the island of the 
kinp:, which is called Bermuda. 

12 However, the people of Columbia were pleas- 
ed with the noble coniiuct of Jones, and for his va- 
liant acts they gave him a sword of curious work- 
manship.

inhabitants, the servants of the kinj^, treated him 
kindly; and showed much re spect for him and his 
ofUcers that were made captive.

tenth month, in the first year of the war, that a cer- 
tain strongf ship of Britain, that liad prepared herself 
to fight a ship of Columbia, appeared upon the wa- 
ters of the mighty deep. 

2 And she was commanded by a valiant captain, 
whose name was Carden, and the name of the sliip 
was the Macedonian. 

3 And on the same day she met one of the strong 
ships of Columbia, the name of the captain whereof 
was Decatur, and the vessel was called the United 
States 

4 Now D. catur was a man who had never known 
fear ; and the good of his country was the pride of 
his heart. 

5 And when he came towards the vessel of the 
king, he used no entreaty wiih his men, for they all 
loved him, and the mot. on ot His finger was as the 
word of his mouth. 

6 So when the ships came nigh urto one anotlcr

7 Kcvertheless, in the space of about ninety min- 
utes, the sjirong ship of Britain struck her reel flag 

to the snipes of Columbia. 

8 Now the Macccloniun was a new ship, and she 

gat much damaj^e. 

9 But the United States, like the companions of 
Shadrach, moved unhurt upon the waters ; nay, even 
her wings were not sino-ed. -»''.^ 

10 And the slain and the wounded, of the ship of 
the kinp;, were five score and four. 

1 1 And tlicre fell of the people of Columbia five 
who were slain outright, and there were seven maim- 
ed : 

12 Moreover, the ship of Britain had seven of the 
stolen men of Columbia therein, who were compel- 
led to fi(=;ht against their brethren j and two of them 
were slain in battle. 

13 And when Carden came on board the ship oF 
Colunibia, he bowed his head, and offered to put his 
sword, of curious workmanship, into the hands of 
Decatur. 

14 But Decatur said unto him, Nay, thou hast de- 
fended thy ship like a valiant man ; therefore, keep 
thy sword, but receive my hand. 

15 So they sat down and drasik wine togethrr ; foi* 
the spirits of brave men mingle even in the tim- of 
warfare. 

16 And after they bad eaten and dr^.nk, Carf^'u 
opened his mouth, for he was troubled in his uiir;!,,

18 And Decatur anbwered, and spake unto Car- 
den, saying, Veiily, thou ait deceived, neither will 
harm happen unto thee. 

19 For, lo ! it came to pass, about three score 
days ago, that one of the strong ships of the king, thy 
muster, the name whereof was called Guerricro, foil 
an easy prey to one of the strong ships of Columbia ; 
and they burnt her with lire upon tljc waters. 

20 Now when Carden heard these words, his heart 
leaped with joy ; for he dreaded the frowns of the 
king, and' he was glad that he stood not alone in the 
thing. 

21 After this, in the eighteen hundred and thir- 
teenth year of the christian era, on the first day of 
the first month of the same year, and on the sixth 
day of the week,

ihere was a heavy fog that day.

New-York, and iliioug'iout the land of Columbia. 

24 Moieovcr, there was a sumj)tuous dinner given 
to Isaac, Decatur, and Jones, in honor of their valiant 
deeds; and the number of he gutsts were about 
five hundred.

feast on the ninth day of the month, for the biavc

2 And the tomahawk and the scalping-knife were 
raised against the people of Columbia on the borders 
of the great Ukes. 

S So the people sought after a valiant man to go 
against the savages and the men of Britain. 

4 And they pitched upon a certain governor of 
one of the states in the west, whose name was Har- 
rison,* and the great Sanhedrim made him chief 
captain of the army.

side of the people of Colun»bia. 

9 They had assailed the liold which is cjillcd after 
a chief captain, whose name was Dearborn, and ilicir 
numbers overpowered it, and they used deceit, and 
pni to death the men, and the women, and the infants 
that were found in the hold, after they had become 
captives, save about half a score. 

10 And their bowlings along the dark forest were 
more terrible than the wild wolf, and their murder- 
ous cunning more dreadful than the prowling tiger. 

1 1 And the servants of the king gave them to 
drink of the strong waters of Jamaica, well know- 
ing that they loved it as they did their own souls. 

12 These were the allies, the messmates, the com- 
panions of the soldiers of Britain ! hired assassins. 

13 However, about this time there were many 
brave captains of the people of the United States that 
went against them, 

14 Even Russ'.;I, and Hopkins, and T upper, and 
Campbell, and Williams, and others, who drove t'le 
red SAVages before them. 

15 And burnt their villages,! and laid waste their 
habitations, and slew many of them ; for it i^ written 
in the holy scriptures, Hlood for blood ! 

16 Veverttieless, they treated the savage prisoners 
who fell into their hands kindly ; ntiiher suffered 
they tlie people to buff ;t them.

20 And the ship of Britain hud become a wreck, 
and the deck thereof was covered with blood ! 

21 Nevertheless, the servants of the king struck 
not the flag of liritaia ; for they were loth and heai- 
tilted : 

22 But when Bainbridge, who saw this, came down 
upon theni a second time, they humbled themselves^ 
and drew down the British cross. 

23 And the slain and the wounded of the king, that 
day, were an hundred three score and ten ; ^ 

34 And those of the people of Columbia, were 
about thirty and four. 

25 Moreover, Bainbridge, the captain of the ves- 
sel of the United Slates, was sorely wounded. 

26 And Lambert, the captain of the ship of the 
kinp^, was wounded, even unto death, 

27 Now when the servants of the king were taken 
from the wreck, and meat and drink sat before them, 
that they might be refreshed, they partook thereof, 
and were thanktul. 

29 And on the second d;»y, Bainbridge put a match 
to the bluek dust that remained in the ship, and she 
burst asunder, anil rent the air with a loud noise. 

29 And the fragments thereof were spread upon 
the waters round about. 

30 And the fish of the sea, even the mighty whales, 
fled from the noise of the explosion. 

3 I However, the ('onstitution escaped not unhurt, 
for she was much wounded in her tackling. 

32 So, when Bainbridge came into the haven of 
St Salvador, which lieih farther to the south, he gave 
the men of Briidin, whom he had m de captive, li-

of Britain were confounded.

seized the tyrants of the ocean. 

35 The smile of joy had departed from their coun-

them. 

36 The wise men and the orators were mute ; 
they gaped upon one another, and wisi not what to 
say. 

37 But the people of Columbia, from the north to 
the south, were jjladdened; and bestowed great 
honor and praise on Bainbridi^e the captain.

became a prey to one of the strong ships of the king, 
Galled the Narcissus : albeit, she fought not. 

9 About this time the vreat waters of the Chesa- 
peake, which empty into the sea, were guarded by 
the strong ships of the kint^, so that the vesaels might 
not arrive or depart therefrom. 

10 But the vessels of the United States, and the 
private vessels of the men of Columbia, were doing 
great damage unto the commerce of Britain, even 
in her own waters. 

1 1 And the number of the private vessels, that 
moved swiftly over the face of the waters, and went 
out to despoil the commerce of Britain, and to cap- 
ture the nferchant vessels thereof, wasubjutiwo 
hundred two score and ten. " ' 

12 And they made capture of more than fifteen 
hundred of the vessels of the people of Brirair,. • 

1.1 Moreover, there was a sore tattle between one 
•f the privvite armed vessels of the people of the 
United States, and a strong sltip jf the king.f 
* 14 The privateer was called the General Arm- 
strong, and the name ofihe captain was Guy.| 

15 Now Ciuv was a valiant num, and fear was a 
stranger to him. . . • - 

16 And on the eleventh day of the third month he * 
copied from afar a vessel wliich appeared as a speck 
upon the waters.

was a fighting slup of Biitain, carrying the de^iroy.^

18 And Guy wa? near beiiig entrapped, for he 
was deceived, ihinkinj^ it w^s a merchant vessel. 

19 Therefore, he was compelled to fight ; so he 
opened upon the vessel of the king, one of his mis- 
chievous engines called, in the vernacular tongue, 
Long-Tom. 

20 And tliey fought hard, and the noi%e of the en- 
gines was very great. 

2 I And the bulls of lead and iron showered around 
like hail-stopics : for the sirong ship of Brituin had 
them in abundance. 

22 Now the slaughter was dreadful on both sides^ 
and Guy was on the point of making capture of the 
•hip: but he received a wound, and his vessel was 
diasbled, so he made good his escape. 

23 And the slain and the wounded of Guy were 
twenty and three, and the vessel of the king lost about 
twice that number. 

2 4 Now, for this valiant act, Guy gat great honor 
and the people gave him a sword of fine uorkiUvMiship. 

25 Moreover, the Saratoga, the Scourge, rhe 
Chciusseur, and many other private vcbteif of tiie 
people of the United States, were a grievoua p'ague 
to the servants of the king ; 

26 Inasmuch as some of them n;ade sport' with 
the mighty blockade of Briti-n, which she put forth 
against the free people of the land of Columbia. 

27 For when they came nigh unto the coast of 
Biira'in, they made capture aijd burnt the vessels of 
the king, that carried rich incichandise, costly jew- 
els, and bilver and gold. t'^^ '■^~"

knew how to construct the swifi-sailinp; vessels, that 
they out-van the strong vessels of Britain. 

SO And as the ships of Britain moved but slowly 
on the waters, so they cauj^ht them not 

31 Wherefore the artificers, the mechanics, and 
those who deal in merchandise, raised their voi< es 
to the great council of Britain, saying, "r^o 

32 Lo ! are we not the faithful servants of the 
king, our master ? have we not given unto him the 
one half of our whole substance ? and shall these 
Yankees take from us the remainder ?

vessel of the Yatikces, in derision of thr proclama- 
tion of our lord the king, hath proclaimed the island 
of Great Britain and her dependencies in a state of 
rigorous blockade ; saying. Lo ! I have the power to 
hem ye in. 

36 Therefore, let the counsellors of the king pon- 
der these things, and let the strong ships of Britain 
drive the vessels of Columbia from our coast. 

37 Now the wise men of Biitain heard those things 
with sorrow ; and they spake one to another concern- 
ing the matter : 

V 38 But they wist not what to do ; for the cunning 
of the captains of the fast sailing vessels of f olum-

t»n the waters of the lake culled Ontario, wcr« com- 
manded by a brave man? whose name was Chauncey.

the army of Columbia, who were gathered on the 
shore of the lakfii went down into the strong vessels 
of Chauncey.

about two thousand. ' - " 

C And Henry* and Zcbulon, whose sir-name was 
Pike,t were the chief captains of the host of Columbia. 

7 On the same day the sails of the vessels were 
spread to tlie winds of heaven, and they moved to- 
wards a place called Little York,t in the province of 
Canada. 

8 Howbeit, the winds were adverse and blew witU 
great violence from the east.

seventh day of the same month, the army of Colum* 
bia, commanded by Pike, the chief captaiO} moved 
out of the strong ships of the United States.

AS And.thcii; weapons of %yar were of curious work- 
manship,* and they sent forth balls of lead ; such as 
were unknown to Pharaoh when he followed the Chil- 
dren of Israel down into the red sea. 

14 Now Zebulon, with a thousand chosen men, fol- 
lowed close after Forsyth, the wai'>ior. 

Ij About thii: time the savages and the servants 
of the king^, even a great multitude, opened their en- 
gines of destruction without mcrc}-. 

16 And from the forest, and the secret places, 
their balls were showered like unto hail-stones, and 
the sound thereof was as sharp thunder. 

17 And a man, whose name was SheafTe, was the 
chief captaiii of the hgsl of Britain. 

18 Now the destroying engines of the strong hold 
of the king issued fire and smoke with a mighty noise 
and shot at the vessels of the United States. 

19 But Chauncey returned unto them four-fold ; 
and the battle wi^xed hot, hoih on the land and on the 
water. 

20 And the men of Columbia rushed forward with 
ilerceness, and drove the men of Britain from their 
strong hold. 

- 31 So they fled towards the town for safety, for they 
\ycre overcon.'? ; and the savages were smitten with 
fear, their loud y^llings ceased, and their feet wer© 
light as the wdd roe ; 

22 Nevertheless, the men of Columbia shouted a- 
Xoud, and sounded their trumpets, their cymbal,^ and 
their noisy drums, which were contrived since the 
days of Jeroboam, king of Israel.

24 So when they found they were nigh bch^j^made 
captive, they departed in haste from the town and 
from the strong hold thereof, save about two score. 

25 Now when the army of Britain was overthrown ; 
v/hcn they were compelled to flee from the strong 
hold ; the wickedness of Satan entered into their 
hearts. 

26 And they gathered together abundance of the 
black dust and fixed it in the lowermost part of tho 
fort, below tlie walls of stone. 

27 Aficr which they put a lighted match nis»;h to itj 
so that when tiie whole army of Columbia got into 
the hold, they might be destroyed. 

28 But the Lord, v/ho is good, even he who go* 
verneth die destinies of /.lan, permllf-d k not. 

29 Now when Zcbulon and his army came out of 
the thick woods, in buttle array, to go forth against 
the strong hold, 

30 Lo ! they saw not the host of Britain ; but the 
eye of Zebulon was as the eye of an eagle, his strengtti 
&s the lion, and his judgment as the wise : 

31 So he stayed his men of war from rushing for- 
ward towards the place, lest they might be entrap- 
ped : and he caused them to move along the wood 
to the right and to the left. - : -. 2 

32 About this time a stripling, from the south* 
V^ith his weapon of war in his ha»d, ran up to Zebu- 
lon, a»d spake unto him, saying, .' > 

83 Behold ! a man of Britain appearethin tlie iort ;

35 And the yoilng man entreated him a second 
time, saying^) I beseech thee, let nic step out before 
the host and slay him, lest the engine be let loose 
upon us ; then Zebulon said unto him, Go. 

36 So he ran out before the army and shot the man^ 
and he fell to the earth ; and it was about a furlong 
oiF, and the weight of the ball was about the weight 
•f a shekel. 

37 But as the young man returned to where the 
army stayed, behold! the black dust in the hold 
caught fire, and it rent the air with the noise of a 
tiiousand thunders : 

38 And the whole army fell down upon their faces* 
to the earth ; and the stones, and the fragments of 
rocks, were lifted high ; and the falling thereof was 
terrible even unto death. 

39 Yea, it was dreadful as the mighty earthquakej 
which overtnrneth cities. 

40 And the whole face of the earth round about, 
and the army of Zebulon, were overshadowed with 
black smoke ; so that, for a time, one man saw not 
another : 

41 But when the heavy clouds of smoke passed 
away towards the west, behold the earth was covered 
with the killed and the wounded. 

42 Alas ! the sight was shocking to behold ; as the 
deed was ignoble.

45 But wlien those who escaped unhurt arose and 
looked around, they beheld not their chieftain ; he 
hud fallen to the earth. 

46 A l)uge stone smote him upon the back, and 
two of his officers, (one of whom was the gallant 
Fraser^*) raised him up and led him forth from the 
field of murder ; the one on the one side, and th'5 
other on the other side. 

47 And as they led him away he turned his head 
around to his brave warriors, and said unto them, G^

48 The magic of his words gave joy to their 
liearls ; for they loved him 'as they loved their own

49 And with resistless force his noble band rush-

land, which reacheth from the north to the south, 
Tnore than eight, thousand miles ; and the breadth 
thereof in about three thousand.

10 That Harrison, the chief captain, from the westi 
the brave warrior, who had entrenched himself in the 
strong hold of iMeigs, nigh unto the river Miami* 
sallied forth against the savages and the men of 
Britain, tliat hemmed him in. 

H Now there were about a thousand soldiers of 
the king, and a thousand savages tbiit had besieged 
the fort many days ; and threw therein the balls of 
destruction, and strove to make captive the army of 
Columbia. 

12 Nevertheless, Harrison, and his gallant little 
band, fought hard against them, and drove them from 
before the strong hold with great sluughijr. *r 

13 Likewise, the slain of Columbia was about hiit 
score, besides the wounded. ' 

14 Moreover, the chief captain gave great honour 
to Miller and ail the captains and soldiers under him j 
even those called militia. 

15 And the names of the states called Ohio and 
Kentucky were raised high, by the valiant acts pf 
their sons that day.

Ontario, essayed to go against Fort George and Fort 
Erie, in the province of the king. 

3 For they had previously concerted their plan 
find matured it ; and taken on board the ships, the 
army of Columbia, and a number of the destroying 
engines. 

4 And when' the vessels of Chauncey came nigh 
unto the place, they let the engines loose upon the 
fort, with a roaring noise.

6 And the men of Britain were friq;htcnctl at the 
sound of the wan'ng instruments that reached their 
camp, and they fle.l in dismay towards the strong 
hold of Queenstown. 

7 And they destroyed their tents, and their store- 
houses, and put a match to tlie black dust of their 
magazines, and blew them up into the air : this they 
did even from Chippewa to Albino. 

fi Moreover, the slain and wounded of the king 
were two hundred two score and ten ; of the men of 
Columbia about three score were slain and maimed. 

9 So the forts George and Eric were captured by 
the army and navy of the United States. 

10 And Henry and Isaac, whose sir-name wa» 
Chauncey, spake well of all the captains and men 
that fought with them. 

1 1 The gallant captains Scott and Forsyth fought 
bravely ; neither were they afraid. 

12 Boyd, and M'Comb, and Winder, and Chandlery 
and Porter, and a host of heroes, turned not aside 
from the heat of the battle, 

13 And here the noble spirit of the youthful Perry 
burst forth into view ; a man made to astonish the 
world, and shower down glory upon the arms of Co» 
lumbiu. 

1 4 Now it happened about the same time, that the 
strong ships of Britain moved towards the other end 
of the lake, to the east thereof, and went against a 
place called Sackett's Harbor. 

15 The fleet of the king was commanded by a chief 
captain whose name was Yeo ; and Prevostj the go- 
vernor of Canada, commanded the army. 

16 And on the morning of the twenty-ninth day of 
the month, they landed more than a thousand men oa 
Uie shores of Columbia.

23 After which they were conveyed to the strong

bravely, and there were many slain and wounded on

Ca/ilure of the Chesafieake — Commodore Dccatuv 
blockaded in /vew-London, 



IN these days the pride of Britain was sorely 
wounded; for she had been discomfited upon the 
Waters of the great deep ; and disappointment had 
sharpened her anp;er. 

?• 2 The people of Columbia had triumphed over her 
ships ; and her mighty armiijs had gained no ho- 
nors. 

^3 Notwithstanding she had made peace with the 
nations of Europe, and her whole strength was turned 
against the people of Columbia. 

4 The prosperity of many hundred year* h^id flat- 
tered her, and she was pufPed up -^ith the vanity 
thereof; yea, she had forgotten herself. 

5 So it came to pass, on the first day of the sixth 
month, that a certain strong ship of the king, called 
the Shannon, appeared before the haven of 13osto», 
which lieth to the east. . ' '• 

6 And she bade defiance to the vessels of Columw-^Jp 
bia; for she had prepared herstll forthe event. ;|% 

7 Now the Chesapeake, a fighting ship of thlf.^,; 
United Stales, was nigh unto the place; and she 
was commanded by the bravC Lawrence, who had 
gained much honor in the sight of the people ; nei- 
ther was he afraid

8 A lid ho went fuPih to battle against the vessel of 
the king, which was conimanclcd by Broke, a valiant 
man. 

''9 Moreover, the mischievous engines thai were 
in the ship of Eiitain were more, and the numbL'rof 
tlicir men greater than those of the vessel of the Uni- 
ted States. 

10 For Broke had gotten about two hundred men, 
iind secreted them ; so that when the hour of danger 
anived thc^ might assist his men, and full unawares 
v.poii il\c men of Lawrence. 

1 1 " vertheless, towards the going down of the 
sun, the ve:;s'"ls drew nigh unto each other, 

12 And Lawrence spake unto his office|^s and his 
mariners, saying : . , 

13 Now shall we set our engines at the work of 
destruction ; let the fire issue out of their mouths, 
as it were like unto fiery dragons/ 

I'i And alLi\ough their numbers he greater than 
ours, yet we may be conquerors j for he who is little 
of spirit guincth nothing. 

15 But if, peradventure, we should be overcome* 
even then shall not the sacted cause of LiBERTt 
perish, neither shall the people of Columbia be dis- 
heartened. 

10 Also, your names shall be recorded as the 
thampions of freedom. 

' 17 And the nations of the earth shall learn with 
aslonibhrncrit, how dearly you prize the inheritance 
of your fathers. 

18 Now when Lawrence had made an end of speak- 
ing, they sat the destroying engines to work, and 
rushed One upon another like fierce tigers. 

19 The fire and smoko were abundant, and tre- 
mendous was the noise that rent tiie air and floated 
upon ihc wutcrs.

20 And the Chesapeake fell close upon. the Shan- 
non, swords clashed with swords, and pikes wilh 
pikes ; and dreadful was the conflict thereof; 

21 But the men of Broke were more numerous 
than the men of Lawrence, and overpowered them, 
by the means of Jieir numbers. 

22 Already had the valiant Lawrence fallen ; lils 
life-blood flowed fast ; still he cried out to his brave 
companions, saying unto them, Don't give up the 
sliip: his noble spirit fled, but his name shall not 
perish. 

23 Moreover, about this time all the oCTicers of 
the ship of the United Stales were cither kluin or 
sorely wounded ; so she was captured by the vessel 
of Che kin [5. 

i?4 Arid Satan rose up in the hearts of the con- 
querors, and they shot the balls of death down into 
the hold of the vessel of the U.Mted States, even 
against the halt and maimed who had surrendered 
tl.cmsclves. 

25 And when the tidlng^s thereof reached the 
kingdom of Great Britain, the loi ^s, the princes, the 
rulers, yea, ail the people were rejoiced beyond 
measure 

26 t\nd they hade their roarinq; cng-iaes utter their

28 Kow the slain and the wounded on board the 
Chesapeake, were tvn hundred two score and four; 
and there fell'bf the servants of the king about v.wo 
hundred. * ' 

,29 Amongst the slain of Columbia were also Au- 
gustus, whose sir-name was Ludlcv>, and another 
brave officer whose name vvas White. 

oO And when the pcopls of Columbia heard of a 
tniih tliat Luwrcnce was slain, they mourned for him 
many days. 

3 1 His Itody was conveyed to a place called Hali- 
fax, in the province of the kini^, where they honored 
his racmorv, and buried him for a while. 

;»2 Bui in a short lime thercaffer his body was 
tuken out of the earth, with the body of Ludlow, andi 
conveyed to the city of New-York, for interment. 

33 And the captain's name who volunteered hia I 
sci'viccs in ihis act of patriotism, and who brouglii; 
the bodies away from Ualifax, was Crowninshield,| 
of Sulcm, in the statt of Massuchusetts. 

34 So Lawrence was buried in the burial-place of 
bis fu'hers, in his own land : and a great multitude of 
people went out to behold the funeral as it passed 
throuc:i\ the citv.

^ OW there was much hard fighting on the bor 
ders, for the nations were wroth against one unother, 
and many men were slain by iho sword. 

2 But it is wi ittcn in the book of Jeremiah tlie 
prophet, that He who is shun by the sword, is belter 
than he who is shun by famine. 

3 Nevertheless, many of the soldiers of Columbia 
suffered hunger : for they had given unto them un- 
wholesome food and a scanty fare, 

4 Although, when the servants of the king became 
caplives to the people of Columbia, they were kind- 
ly treated, and partook of the fat of the land. 

5 Now it came to pass, in the second year of the 
war, on the twenty-third day of the sixth month, 

6 That a captain lif the United States, whose sir- 
name was Boerstler, was ordered to go forth from 
the strong hold of Fort George, to annoy the enemy. 

7 And the name of the place where he essayed to 
go, was called Beaver-dams, being distant from the 
strong hold of Queenstown about seventy furlongs.

12 And they nndc a covenant in writingi between 
one another, but the men of Britain violated the co-

the oflicers of their swords, and their apparel, yea, 
even the shoes from off their feet. 

14 After which the men of Columbia were com- 
rranded to go, in boats, down to the strong hold of 
Kingston, in thn province of the king. 

15 But a certain brave captain, called Chapin,* a 
cunning man withal, made his escape in a boat, and

by the strength of his single arm, overpowered three

savages, who had been instructed in the ways of God,

them under their care, 

20 And sent good men amongst them to preach 
the gospel, and instruct them in the sublime dociriiie 
of the Saviour of the world. 

21 And tl>ey hearkened unto the preachers, and 
were convinced, and their natures were softenfed. 

22 Amongst these tribes were those who wore 
called the Six nations of New-York Indians : 

23 And their eyes were opened, and they saw the 
evil and wickedness of Britain. 

24 So their chiefs and their counsellors rose up 
and made war against the province of Canada, and 
fought against the hired savages of the king of Bri-

25 But in all their acts they suffered *■ the spirit

JJaira o?i Lake Ontario^ between the feeta of Ccw. 
C/iauncey and Hir Janiea Yco, 



In those days, tlic great waters of the lake Ontaric> 
were troubled \s\i\\ the movements of the fighting 
ships of Columbia, as well as those of the king. 

2 Now the fteet of tlie king, which was commanded 
by Yco, who w^as a skilful captain, was greater than 
the fleet of Columbia, which was commanded Uy the 
brave Chauncey. 

3 And they had contrived to move to and fro upon 
the bosom of the lake Ontario many months. 

4 And two of the small vessels, called the Julia 
tind the Growler, being parted from the fleet, fell in- 
to the hands of Yeo. 

5 Nevertheless, Cbauncey followed after Yco, and 
hemmed him in for a time. 

6 But a strong west wind arose and the fleets were 
again separated. 

7 After this Chauncey captured a number of small 
fighting vessels, and about three hundred soldiers of 
the king. 

8 Now it was so, that when Yeo put his fleet in 
battle array, as though he would fight, 

9 Then Chauncey went out against him, to meet 
^m, and give him battle j but the lieart of Yeo fail-

ed him, and he turned aside from the ships of Colum. 
bia. 

10 So Chaunccy sa'lcd along the borders of the 
}uke, from the one end to the other ; even from Nia- 
gara to Sackett's Harbor, and Yeo followed him not. 

1 i Now all the vessels of the king-, and all the 
vessels of the United States, that carried the dc- 
siroyin.5 cnj^ines, upon the lake Ontario, being num- 
bered were about seventeen. 

12 Howsoever, they cut down the tall trees of the 
forest, and hewed them and built many more stroni; 
vessels ; although they had no gophar-wood amongst 
'^hem in these days. 

13 And they made stories to them, even to the 
third story., and they put windows in them, and they 
pitched them within and without with pitch j after 
the f »,hion o{ the ark. 

14 And, lo ! some of the ships which they built 
upon the lake, carried about an hundred of the en- 
gines t)f death. 

15 And the weight of a ball which they vomited 
forth was about a thousand shekels. 

16 Now the rest of the acts of Chauncey and Yeo, 
which they did, are they not written in the book of 
Palmer, the scribe ?•

8 Moreover, the wickedness which had been com-

the shores of Virginia lo lake Champlain. 

9 Accordingly, all tlie women and children, who 
were able, suddenly departed from the place, lest the 
Same thing* migiht, peradventure, happen unto them. 

10 Neither were they deceived in judgment: for, 
lo 1 when tlic place was given up, and a covenant 
made, the servants of the king proved faithless. 

1 1 They abided not by the contract ; saying, Pish I 
ye are but Yankees, therefore will we do to you as 
scemeth meet unto us I 

12 So they burnt the houses, and all other things 
bcloninng to the United States^ with fire.

strong hold before the town, they fled in disniay. 

10 Now while these thintjs were passinij in the 
north, the greedy sons of Britain were laying dcso" 
late the small villages of the south. 

20 On the waters of the Chesapeake they cap,, 
turcd the small vessels and made spoil thereof. 

21 Moreover, they gat possession of a sm.dl place 
called Kent Island, and robbed the poor and needy ; 
for there was no mercy in them. 

22 Yea, it was said of a truth, and talked abroad, 
that they came in the night time, and disturbed the 
small cattle, and the fowls, and took them for their

24 Even the state of North-Carolina escaped them 
not ; they landed a thousand men of war at a place

25 And again the work of destruction began ; they

J\[ajo7' Croghan defeats the British and Indians, wim 
dcr Gen. Proctor^ in their attack on Fort Ste/ih^cn' 
eonj Lower Sanduski/. 



^ EVEUTHELESS, it came to pass, that Han^- 
t:on,. the chief captain of the northwest army, had 
])laccd a captain, a youncj man, in the hold called 
It'ort Stephenson, to defend it. 

2 Now ilic fort lieth at the western end of th€ 
great lake Erie, at a place caHed Sandusky. 
V 3 And the number of the soldiers that were with 
the youih in the hold, was about an hundred an<l 
thrcQ sci.re, and they had only one of the destroying 
engines. 

4 Now the name of the young man was George, 
jjiul his sir-name was Croghan. 

5 So, on the fiist day of the eighth month, about the 
going down of the sun, a mighty host from Maiden 
appeared before the hold ; 

C Even a thousand savages, and about five hundred 
|ncn of war of Britain ; and Proctor was the com- 
mander thereof. 

7 Moreover, they brp^ught the instruments of . de- 
struction in great plenty ; even howitzers, whic^i 
were not known in the days of the children of Isrijiel*

8 And they had prepared themselves for the fi'jht, 
and encompassed the place round about) both by land 
and by water. 

9 After which Proctor sent a message to tlie 
brave Croghan, by a captain whose name w;is Elliot, 
and the words thereof were in this sort : 

10 Lol now yc can neither move to the right nor 
to the left, to escape, for we have hemmed you in ; 

1 1 Therefore, that your blood may not be spilt in 
vain, we command that ye give up the strong hold 
into the hands of the servants of the king, and become 
captives. 

'.2 We have the destroying engines in abundancej 
and wc are a numerous host. 

13 Furthermore, if ye refuse, then shall the wild 
savages be let loose upon you ; and there shall be 
none left among^ you to j^o and tell the tidings there- 
of- ^ "V • s--' J ., 

14 But when Croghan heard the message, hcan* 
swered and said utito Elliot, Get thee now to thy 
chief captain, and say unto him, I refuse ; neither^ 
will I hearken unto hiin : 

15 And if it be so, that he come against me with 
his whole host, even then will I not turn aside from 
the fierce battle j though his numbers were as the 
sand on the sea shore. 

1 6 Lo ! David, of old, with a sling; and a stone, 
slew the mighty Goliah : and shall the people of Co- 
lumbiii be afraid, and bov before the tyrants of E\j,« 
rope ? 

17 Then EJliot returned to the army of the kii% ; 
and immediately the mouths of their engine^ were 
ppened aguiust the fort. *

18 And the noise thereof continued a long time ; 
even until the next day ; but their baitcring prevailed 
not. 

19 Now when Proctor saw it ^v^s of no avail, he 
divided his host into two bdnd»i and appointed a cap« 
tain to each band; and they moved toward^ the fort 
ami 'assailed it with great violciice. 

20 But the nxen of Crojjjlian were prepared for 
them ; and they let loose thtir weaprms of war upon 
them, and set their dcsir(>)iiig engines to work, and 
smote the fnen of Britain, nip and thigh, with great 
slaughter 

21 And the deep ditch that surrounded the fort 
>va3 strewn wiih ihcir sLiin and their wounded. 

22 So tlie host ol Britain were dismayed and over- 
thrown, and fl d in confusion from the fort into the 
forest ; from whence, in the dead of the night, they 
went into their vessels, i.nd departed from the place. 

23 Now tiie loss of the men of Britain was about 
an hundred two score and ten ; and of the men of 
Columbia there wis one slain and seven wounded. 

' 34 But when Proctor had rested his army he sent 
a skilful physician to heal the maimed which he had 
fled from and left behind 

25 But Harrison, the chief captain, said unto him, 
Already have my physicians bound up their wounds, 
and given them breid and wine, and comforted them ; 
after the manner of (jiir country. 

26 For we suffer not the captives that fall into our 
hands to be buffeted or maltreated j nehher want they 
for any thing. 

27 So the physician of thr> king's army was permit? 
^d to return to his own camp.

Now the wav continued to rage without abatement 
upon the waters of the great deep ; 

2 And manifold were the evils that came upon the 
children of men by the means thereof. 

3 Moreover, the great Sanhedrim of the people 
vrere forced to bestir themselves ; and they had con- 
tinued their councils day after dr\y without ceasing* 

4 And it came to pass, that there was a dreadful 
battle fought between a vessel of the king, and a pri- 
vate vessel of Columbia. 

5 Now the name of the vessel that fought was De- 
catur, and the captidn's name was Diron, a GauL 

6 And it was so, that about the fourth day of the 
• eighth month, the Decatur having sailed out of the 

haven of Charleston, being in the state of South Car^ 
olina, fell in with one of the fighting vessels of the 
king, called the Dominica. 

7 liut the destroying engines of the king's vessel 
were two fold gieiucr in numbers than those of \V^' 
Decatur.

8 Nevertheless, Miey set them to work, so that they 
groaned beneath the fire and smoke ; 

9 A.nd in about the space nf an hour the Doroinicft 
wus conquered and taken captive. 

10 For when the vessels came close togctherf the 
tnen smote one another with their swords and weapons 
oi" war; yea, even the balls of iron they cast at eaeli 
other, with their hands, and slew one another with 
wonderi'ul slaughter. 

1 1 Inasmucli as there were slain and maimed of 
the king three score souls ; those of the Decatur 
wore about a score : morc<,vor the captain of the 
Dominica \vas slain. 

12 The fight was an unequal one ; and the brave- 
ry of Diron gained him a great name, for he over- 
came the enemies of freedom j although their force 
was greater than his. 

13 After this, on the fourieenih day of the samo 
month, there was another sore battle between a 
small vessel of the United States, called the ArgUa, 
and the Pelican, a ship of ihc king, l' ,;:«,,. 

14 Now the Pelican was somewhat stronger than 
the Argus, and they were stubborn and kept the de- 
stroying engines to work, with great noise, about for- 
ty and five minutes. 

15 And the brave capiiiiu of the Argus, whose 
name was Allen, was wounds d unto dcJi, and the 
vesacl of Columbia was capturvct by the ship of Bii- 
tain, the name of the comnuaidcr whereof was Ma- 
ples. 

16 Of the men of Columbia six were slain and 
seventeen w )unded ; ot the mil) of liiitum tiio Si«iii

row throughout the land of Columbia, for he had de- 
fended the vessel of the United States nobly : and 
captured some merchant ships of Britain. 

18 Even the eneuiy regarded him for his bravery, 
for they b-.v'ed him with honor in their o>vti country, 
not fur trom the place where he became captive, 
which was in the waters of the king, even in St. 
George's Channel. 

19 But it came to pass, on the fifth day of the 
next month, in the same year, 

30 That a certain small vessel of Columbia, car- 
rying the engines of destruction, commanded by a 
gallant man, whose name was Burrows, fell in with 
another sniall vessel of the king» called the Boxer, 
ami the captain thereof was a brave man, and his 
name was Blythe. 

21 In the language of the people of the land, the 
vessel of Columbia was called the Enterprize. 

22 Now when the vessels drew nigh unto each 
other the men shouted with loud shouting. 

23 And immediately they let the mischievous ert- 
gines loose upon one another, with a noise like unto 
thunder. 

"24 But it happened, that in about the space of for* 
ty minutes, the Boxer was overcome ; but she was 
taken somewhat una w ires : 

25. For, lo I the pride of the men of Britain had 
lYiudc them foolish : and, thinking of the conquest, 
they nailed Britannia's red-cross to the mast of the 
•vessel. 

26 Whereupon, after they were overcome, they 
cried aloud for mercy, sayint^, 

27 Behold ! our colors are fast ; and we cannot 
quickly unloose them : nevenhcless, \ve will be pri- 
soners unto you, therefore spare us.

28 So the brave mariners of Columbia spai'ed 
them, and stopped the destroying engines ; for their 
hearts were inclined to mercy. 

29 However, this was another bloody fight ; for 
there fell of the men of Britain forty that were slain 
outright, and seventeen were wounded » 

30 And the loss of Columbia in slain and maimed 
was about fourteen. 

31 And the commanders of both vessels were 
slain ; and they buried them with honor in the town 
of Portland, which leaveth Boston to the west ; for 
the battle was fought hard by.

6 Nevertheless, it came to pass, in the one thou- 
sand eight hundrfcd and thirteenth year, on the tenth 
day of the ninth moiith, early in the morning, about 
the rising of the sun, 

7 The valiant Perry beheld the fleet of the king 
at a distance upon the lake ; so he unmoored his ves- 
sels and went out to meet them in battle array, fleet 
against fleet. 

8 And when their white sails wfere spread upon the 
bosom of the lake, they appeafed like unto a squad- 
ron of passing clouds. 

9 A gentle breeze wafted the hostile vessels to- 
wards one another. 

10 It was silence upon the waters; save when the 
sound of musical instruments fell sweetly up*^ tire 
car. 

11 Cut it happened, a little before the mid-day, 
that the shouts of the men of war of Britain wei*j9 
heard, and the shouts of the men of Columbia. ,^- 

12 And now the destroying engines began to utter 
their thunders, vomiting forth fire and smoke and 
brimstone in abundance. 

13 And suddenly the waters were in ain uproar}, 
and the bellowing noise sounded along the lake. * -,'

to anolhcr fi.Lyhiiu^ vessel of the United States, call-

name was Elliot. 

20 After tiiis again the Vessels uttered their thun- 
ders and fought hard, and the men of Columbia pour* 
ed out destruction upon the servants of the king. 

2 1 And it came to pass, that the skilful contrivance 
of Perry, and the bravery of his men, at length 
forced the whole fleet of the king to become captive 
— even unto the cock-boats of Coliiml)ia.

18 So M'Arthur, in whom the chief captain put

12 And the weapons of war were used without 
mercy; the foxes and the beavers crept into the ir 
holes, for the destroying engines frightened the wild 
beasts, so that they looked for their hiding places. 

13 The gallant Johnson* fell upon them with a 
band of chosen horsemen, and he drove th§m before 
him like chaff before the wind, and smote their chief 
warrior,! and slew him with his own hand, so that hd 
fell to the earth.

Britain on all sides, and overcame them, and made 
them prisoners of war; whereupon the engines ceas-

savages were slain.

two score and two were wounded. - " " ' 

19 But the men of Kentucky and Ohio, whose

slaughtered at iTie River Raisin, slew not a single 
captive. ' 

20 But they treated them as mrm ; thus rendering 
eooD rot. JcviL. according to the word of the Lord. 

21 Moreover, (hey captured six of the destroying 
engines that were made of brass, and two that were 
made of iron ; besides many weapons of v/ar. 

32 Now three of the brass engines were those 
given to the men of Britain, at the capture of Detroitf 
the first year of the war, and were the same that had 
been taken from the king in the duys of Washing- 
ton. 

23 Soon after the battle, Harrison returned with 
his army to Detroit, where many of the savages had 
assembled to repent of their evils, and ask for mercy 
from the chief captain. 

*4 So Harrison made a Covenant with them, and 
they were thankful, and gave hiih hostages.

Columbia, and the hearts of the people were exceed-

clave to the roof of their mouths.

10 But the horsenien, and the whole army of Jack-

great slaughter, and overcame them. 

11 And the number of savages slain that day was 
about three hundred ; and a red-cross banner of the 
Spanish nation was found amongst them, and taken." 

,13 Seventeen pf the men of Columbia were slain, 
and about four score wounded. 

13 So, when the battle w^s over, Jackson returned 
to his own camp. 

14 After these things had come to pass, oi) the

derness more than an hundred miles, to a town built 
upon a place called by the savat^es the Holy-ground, 
where three ol" the Indian i)rophets dwelt. 

'20 Now there were lyinp; prophets among the sa- 
vages, even as there were in the days ol" old, among 
the children of Israel ; and they prophesied accord- 
ing to their own wishes j 

21 And those of shallow understanding believed 
them, and were led into a snare, whereby their 
whole tribe was nigh being destroyed. 

22 And Wciherford, the chief warrior of the 
Creek nation, was there abo with his band. 

23 And he fought hard against Claiborne ; but he 
■was overthrown, and lied, and the town was burnt, 
even two hundred houses. 

24 Notwithstanding all these tribulations, the de-

25 So Jackson, the chief captain, went out against 
them with his army, and attacked them at their strong 
hold, on the waters of the Tallapoosie, where they 
•were entrenched, with more than a thousand war- 
riors. 

26 Now this was on the twenty and seventh day of 
the third month, in the one thousand eight hundred

"work, and fought desperate' against them, for about 
the space of five hours ; when he overcame them, so

31 Thus did iho nicn of Columbia triumph over

32 And so the ji;d;^'neut cf the Lord fell upon 
them for tl'cir umi;.>;!iie'jusiicss, and for ihcii* wic-i^-id 
and murderous deeds. 

33 After which they repented of their evilj having, 

through their own folly, lost many thousand war- 
riors. 

34 And their chief warriors gave up their instru- 
ments of destruction, and laid them at the feet of 
Jackson, the chief captain. 

35 Even Wetherford, the chief warrior, gave him- 
self up to Jackson, saying, I fought with my might ; 
but I have brought evil upon my nation ; and thou 
hast slain my warriors; and I myself am overcome. 

36 Now the savages are easily imlamcd and roused 
to works of sin and death ; and of their weakness the 
servants of the king are not ashamed to take advan- 
tage ; even to tlie ruin of the poor and ignorant bar- 
barians. 

37 So the warriors and the whole nation of the 
Creeks, being tired of a destructive war, entreated

iO Now the army of Hampton rested nigh unto 
lake Champlain ; and about the same time he moved 
towards the borders of the king. 

1 1 And Wilkinson sent a mcseenger to him and 
entreated him to come and meet him, and join the

12 The same night Wilkinson with his army 
crossed the great river St. Lawrence, near by the

22 Now when the ininy of Wilkinson heard those 
things, they were discouraged ; and all the plans that 
had been devised by Armstrong,* the chief captain^ 
and scribe of the great Sanhedrim, were of no avaih 

23 So the army of Wilkinson crossed the river 
again and came into the land of Columbia, at French

10 After this, it came to pass on the nineteenth 
clay of tliC same month, early in the morning, before 
the dawning of tliC day, about fificcn hundred of the 
Savages and soldiers of xhM. king crossed the riveP

lumbia, ■while t'liey were yet asleep in their tents ; 
and overcame them, and took the fort, and put the 
garrison to the sword ; even the women and children 
suiTered under the savago tomahawk. 

12 Nov,- the people cf Columbia, who were massa- 
cred that day, were about two hundred two score and 
ten. 

13 But the c.Main of the hold, whose name was 
Leon'dril, was charged with the evil ; for he had left 
the fort, av.d neglected that duty which should ever 
be tlie pride of a r>oldier. 

14 Nevertheless, when they had committed all this 
horrid slaughter, the barbarians were not fully glut-

jN OW while the great lakes and rivers were bound 
in fellers of ice, and the armies of Columbia slum- 
bered in the winter camps of the north ; 

2 And whilst the conquering sword of Jackson 
spread ruin and desolation among the misguided sa- 
vages of ihe south ; 

3 Lo ! new scenes of warflire appeared upon the 
waters of the great deep. 

4 In ihe first year of the war David> whose sir- 
name was Porter, sMled from the shores of Coluiiif 
bia towards the south, tliat he might capture the ves- 
sels of the men of Britain. 

5 And the ship which he commanded was one of | 
the strong vessels of Columbia, called the Essex. 

6 Now David was a valiant man, and he had con- 
trived a plan to annoy the commerce of Britain in the 
waters of the great Pacific Ocean. 

7 So, in process of time, he passed around the fur- 
thermost part of the land of Cplumbia, which is call- 
ed Cape Horn, and lieth far to the south ; near the | 
country of Patagonia, which is inhabited by the bar- 
barians, ai>d sailed toyvards the haven of V alparais.c.

moved along the coast of Peru, till he came to Lima, 
^vli«re it never rains : 

9 A country where gold and silver are found in 
abundance, and where there is one continual summer^^^jj-. 
and the trees blossom throughout the year. 

10 Again, he prepared his vessels, and sailed from 
Lima towards the north, until he fell upon the islands 
of Gallapagos; called the enchanted islands. 

1 1 Now these islands lie upon the west side of the 
great continent of Columbia, under a meridian sun, 
beneath the girdle of the world. 

12 Hereabouts he captured a multitude of the mer" 
chant ships of Britain, laden with rich merchandize^ 
and silver and gold. 

13 And he fixed a score of the destroying engines 
into one of the ships he had taken ; and made her a 
fighting vessel, and called her name Essex Junior, 
and a man; whose name was Downs, he made cap- 
tain thereof. 

14 And he fell upon the fishermen c ' Britain, and 
captured those who went out to eatch the mighty 
whales, which afford oil to give us light m the night 
time, and bones to shade our daughters from the 
scorching sun of the noon»day. 

15 Moreover, David went to an island where 
dwell wild savages, and established himself so that he 
could go out and return whensoever he chose. 

16 And when he departed from the island, which 
he cMlcd after the chief governor of the land of Co- 
lumbia in those days,* he left some of his men, with 
the weapons of war to defend the place.

17 Now Divid was a grievous thorn in the side of 
Britain, and he almost destroyed her commerce in the 
South Seas: 

18 Inasmuch as he put the wise men of the king 
to thcii' wits end ; for they were unable to out-sail 
him and take him captive. 

19 So they sent their strong ships in search of him, 
by two's, over the whole face of the waters of the 
Southern Ocean ; and the expense thereof would 
have made wore than two feasts for the Prince Re- 
gent, who govcpicd Engh'.nd in the name of his far 
thcr. 

20 However, it came to pass, that David returned 
again in his ship to the haven of Valparaiso; and the 
vessel, called the Essex Junior, atconipanied hirn. 

21 Now Downs, who commanded her, had been 
to the place before, and conducted ijie prizes of Da- 
vid therp, and brought him the tidings that he was 
likely to be ensnared upon the waters. 

22 So, whilst David was there, on the twenty- 
eighth day of the third montli, in thp eighteen hun- 
dred and fourteenth year of the Clu'istian era, 

23 He looked around, and behold ! he saw two of 
the strong ships of Britain approaching, for the pur- 
pose of hemming him in ; the one called the Phoebe, 
and the other the Cherub. 

24 But his heart sank not within him, for he knew 
no cowardice ; but, with tlic wisdom of a brave man, 
he strove to escape, as the vessels were top pov>erful 
for him. 

25 But the winds were adverse, and blew hard, 
and prevented the tacklings of his ship from taking 
effect : 

26 Nevertheless, David said nnto the captains of 
the king, Come singly, and r.ot like cowards, upon

inc ; then shall yc receive the thunders of the free- 
men of Columbia abundantly ; 

27 Aiid her fame shall not suffer, although in the 
contest ye may destroy my vessel upon the face of 
the wat'.M's. 

23 Dut llillyar, the captain of the king's ship call- 
ed the Phoebe, was afraid lest he should be over- 
come. 

29 Now, when David found he was unable to 
make good his escape, he drew nigh tb.e land, that he 
might be protected by the great law of nations; for 
it was a place friendly to both parties. 

30' But in tl'.is he was deceived ; for the authorities 
of Spain trembled at the nod of the servants of Bri- 
tain, in whom there was no faith. 

31 So both vessels came upon him, like ravenous 
wolves, in the very haven of Valparaiso; thus trans- 
gressing the law of nations, and committing an out-' 
rage wliich hath few examples under the sun. 

32 And they set their engines to work upon the 
Essex with all their might. 

33 Nevertheless, David fought against them with 
desperation, for there was no hope left for him to es- 
cape ; neither did he expect mercy. 

84 And he held out for more than the space of two 
hours, when he became overpower;;d ; having his 
ship a sinking wreck, covered with blood, and on fire ; 
with about an hundred and fifty of his men slain and 
maimed. 

35 So, after David had fought hard, he became 
captive to the ships of the king ; who had also $ome 
of their men slain, and some wounded. 

36 Moreover, Hillyar gave him praise and called 
him a man oL* courage ; for he fought against two 
Strong ships of IJritain.

37 And David made a covenant with Hillyal*, in 
Avhich the Essex Junior was given unto him and his 
men, that they might return in her again to their own 
country. 

38 And it came to pass, in the seventh month of 
the same year of the battle, David arrived in the 
city of New -York ; having been absent about twa

Battle of BridgewatfT, 



Now about this time there was peace among tlia 
etrong powers of Europe ; and the strength of Bri* 
tain was free to be employed against the people of 
Columbia. ' > 

2 So she increased her navy on the shores of Co- 
lumbia, and strengthened her armies in Canada ; and 
gent skilful men to conduct them and to fight her bat- 
tles : 

3 And, in her spite, she emptied out the vials of 
her vengeance upon the United States. 

4 Notwithstanding, it came to pass, on the twenty 
fifth day of the same month. 

5 That another bloody battle was fought hard by, 
a*, a place called B ridge vviiter, from whence ye might 
behold the stupendous water-falls of Niagara.

wounds, and had reiumcd his command, he sullied' 
out of Fort Erie with his men, and went agftiil!>t the 
camp of the servants of the kine^. 

19 And by lis br, very and skill, and that of the 
vdiant captains under him^ he took and destroyed' 
tht-ir strong holds, and slew many of them, so that 
their loss was about a thousand fighting men* 

20 Aiid the slain and wcun '3d of Jacob's army 
were two hundred ninety and nme.

men, are they not written in all the books of tho

I'le men of Columbia, went away from the place

tl . brave M'Arthur, who had remained at the strong

and went more than an hundred miles into the pro-

26 And the men of Columbia that went with him 
were valiant men. from the state of Kentucky and 
Ohio ; in number about eight hundred. 

37 Victory perched upon their arms, and they 
slew some of the servants of the king, and made 
many prisoners, and returned again with the loss of 
one man. 

28 In the meanwhile, the army of Izard crossed

into their winter camps at Buffalo.

T Now this weed is a native of the land of Co-

8 And Monroe,* the chief scribe of the great 
Sanhedrim, was there ; and Armstrong,! and many 
other friends of the land of Columbia. 

9 Nevertheless, the wisdom of all their plans fail-

captain, flee before the host of Britain.

And they were now unable to prevent the tvil.

have been prevented.* 

17 Nevertheless, it proved a blessing ; for it uni- 
ted the people of Columbia as one man, M^ainst the 
tyrants of the earth. 
.18 Now the place that had been pitched upon to 
^ build the chief city, was in a fine country, and a 
beautiful spot, in the District of Columbia. 

19 But the inhabitants round about the City of 
Washington were few ; for they had, as it were, just 
began to build it. 

20 There was much ground laid out for the city, 
but the builrlings therein were not many ; neither 
Nvas it fortified.

place^ they looked around, in surprise, and cried 
out with astonishment, saying, 

22 L<^the city hath fled with the people, fbt 
thtre are but an handful oi' houses in the place. 

23 However, the next day they began tlic work of 
destruction, like unto the barbarians of ancient 
times ; for their wickedness followed after them as 
ihe shadow folio weih after the substance. 

24 And they destroyed the beautiful edifices with 
fire, even the palace of the great Sanhedrim. " 

^5 Now Cockburn was loath that his wicked 
deeds should be handed down :o future gencrationa ; 
so he went and destroyed, with his own hands, the 
chief printing-oflice* of the city, and scattered the 
types abroad ; 

26 Because, as he alledged, the printer had, in 
times past, uttered many hard things against him. 

27 Thus did he, even Cockburn, like an ignorant 
savage, stamp his own name with infamy, and make 
it become a reproach amongst all mankind. 

28 Science and learning blushed at the cham«» 
pions of England, who had been represented as i!ic 
bulwark of religion ; but who were, in reality, the 
supporters of idolatry ; the stafi' of Juggernaut, the

29 Now the art of printing was not known among

32 Even those that had been gathered together 
for instruction ; the toil of many years ; containing 
the lep.rning and wisdom of ages.

great Icarninj^. and he had abundance oi books of all 
iiatl -liSj and in all languages, even ten thousand vo-

42 So the great Sanhedrim accepted the offer of 
Thomas, and they retain the books to this day. 

45 Now it came to pass, in the evening of the 
same day, on which the vandals of Britain set fire to 
the city, that the army of the king fled from the

50 So it happened, after they had trusted to the 
faith of the servants of the king; Gordon, a captain 
of the ships in the river PotoniaCi came up against 
them before the town ; 

5 1 And took their merchant ships ; and compell- 
ed the people to open their store-houses, and put in- 
to the vessels their flour, even sixteen thoilsand bar-

hogsheads of the sweet-scented plant.

hour, when Macdonongh beheld the fleet of Britain 
sailing boldly towards him.

Battle of Platt&burgh^-defeat of Sir George Pre* 

vast. 



Now while. Macclonough was capturing the royal 
fleet of Britain, upon the lake, the gallant Macomb 
scattered destruction amidst the ai my of Prevost. 

3 And the battle raged with great violence, and 
the men of Britain strove hard to pass over the 
river called Saranac ; 

3 But the men of war of Columbia, who were 
upon the opposite side of the water, opposed them, 
and slew them with great shiughter. 

4 And the brave Grobvenor, and Hamilton, and 
Hiley, and the gallant Cronk, drove them back from 
crossing the bridges. 

5 Likewise, many were slain in the river, so that 
the waters of the Saranac were dyed vith the blood 
of the servants * f the kingc 

6 But M:v. omb kept the entwines at work ; and 
Brooks, and Richards, and Smith, who were in the 
forts, displayed much valor, and cause d the engines 
to vomit fire and siuoke. aJ'd balls of heavy metal. 

7 Howsoever, when Prevo'-t saw that •^he king's

his whole urmy was amazed.

8 Notwithstanding this, they continued to cast 
llieir \ alls, and their rockets, and their bomb-shells, 
and their sharpnelis, with all their might. 

9 Now these sharpnells were unknown even to 
the children of Columbia, for they were lately in- 
rented by the wise men of Britain. 

10 And the people of Columbia trusted in the 
strength of their arms, more than in the strength of 
these shells, so they used them not. 

1 1 Nevertheless, the army of the king fought 
hard with their battering-rams, against the strong 
hold rf Columbia, until the setting of the sun, when 
their noises were silenced by the brave band of Co- 
lumbia. 

11 So the same night, Prevost, and the invinci- 
cles of the king, fled towards the strong hold of 
Montreal ; leaving their sick and wounded behind to 
the mercy of the men of Columbia ; destroying their 
provisions, which in their haste they could not 
carry away. 

13 And the men of Coluinbia followed them a lit- 
tle way, and slew some, and made many captives. 

14 Thus were the men of war of l^ritain conquer- 
ed in the north, army against army, fleet against 
fleet, and squadron ag^^inst squadron. 

15 And the killed and wounded of the army of the 
king that day, weie about a thousand ri^cn ; r.nd 
about three hundred, who were tired ol' t'Ju'ir b juc^- 
age, left the service of t'^e king,* and j /ucd the

bravery ; and his name shall be remembered by ages 
yet unborn. 

17 Moreov r, he spake well of all the officers and 
men who fought with him. 

13 And Mooers, who commanded the brave hus- 
bandmen of New -York and Vermont, and Stronn^, 
the valiant chief captain of the men called volun- 
teers, had great hoiior for their noble deeds. 

19 Likewise, \pplini»;» a"d Wool, and Leonard 
and Sproul, distinguished themselves among the 

brave. 

20 But when the news of the capture of the fleet, 
and the d^^feat of their mighty army, reached the 
lords of Britain, they pnt their fingers in their ears, 
that they might not hear it : 

21 Neither would they believe it ; but when they 
found it was so of a truth, they were enraged out of 

measure. 

22 And their wise men and their counsellors said, 
Lo 1 we have only been ii ifiing with these Yankees ;

Now when Ross and Cockburn returned from 
their burning and pillagint^, and all the barbarities 
they committed at Washington, the chief city, and 
i.he nc-igld)orliood thereof; 

2 End)o!dened by the success of their iinri^qht-

in which they had taken so much pleasure at Hamp- 
ton, Havrc-dc-Grace, and Wasi.ington. 

4 But they had a mightier pi;>ce than Washington 
to go agidnsi; ; for Bidtimore is a great city, con-

pli.ce culled North Point, which lieth at the entrance 
of the river Petapsco, about an hundred furlonii;3 
from the city, and beijan to put their men of war 
Upon the shore. 

7 And the number of their chosen fip^lrting men, 
who were landed, were about eight thousand. 

8 And when they were all moved out of the boalsj 
Ross, the chief captain, conducted them on towarc's 
the city. 

9 As they moved along their instruments of war 
glittered in the beams of the sun , and the waving 
of their squadrons was like unto the troubled waters 
of the ocean. 

JO However, when they came to a place called 
Bear Creek, lo I the army of Columbia met them 
in battle array. 

1 1 For, when the gallant young men of B^iltimore 
heard the rumor, that the soldiers of Britain were 
coming upon them ; 

12 With the spirit of freemen, they grasped their 
weapons of war in their hands, and went out to meet 
them without fear ; resolved to conquer or to die.* 

13 For well they knew, that life would be a bur- 
then to them, when their habitations were consumed 
with fire ; their parents slaughtered ; and the i«ino-

23 Neverlheless, the men of Columbia were not 
powerful enough to overcome the servants of the 
kin^ ; so they drew back into their entrenchments, 
and sti onj? holdb, tl.at were upon the: high places 
round ubout the city. 

24 And Rogers, and Findley, ard Harris, and 
Siiles were among the captains of the strong holds; 
and were all faithful men. 

25 But it came to pass, the next day, when the 
men of Ikitain saw that the men of Columbia were 
well prepared for battle, that they were afraid to go 
against the strong holds. 

26 So in the nuddle of the night, which was dafk 
and rainy, they departed from the place, and returned 
to their vessels, that they might escape the evil that 
was preparing for them. 

27 Moreover, they took the dead body of Ross, 
their chief captain, with them, and cast it into a ves* 
sel, filled with the strong waters of Jamaica ; 

28 That the instrument of their wickedness might 
be preserved, and conveyed to the king, their mus- 
ter, and be buried in his own country.

A home and a country, should leave us no more ! 

Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps*

No refuge could save the hireling and slave, 
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,

^ OW, it happened that, in the land of Columbia, 
there arose up wise and learned men, whose cun- 
ning had contrived and invented many useful things. 

2 Among these there appeared one whose inge- 
nuity was exceedingly great, inasmuch as it astonish- 
ed all the inhabitants of the earth : 

3 Now the name of this man was Robert, sir- 
named Fulton ; but the cold hand of death fell upon 
him, ami he slept with his fatheis, on the twenty and 
third day of the second month of the eighteen hun<«i 
dred and fifteenth year of the Christian era. 

4 Howev«'r, the things which he brought into 
pmctice in his lifetime will be recorded, and his 
uainf sp(;kcnof by generations yet unborn. 

5 Although, like oth*rr men of genius, in these 
days, he was spoken of but slightly at first i tor the 
people said, Lo ! the man is beside himsi-lf ! ai>d they 
laughed at him ; nevertheless, he exceeded their ( 3C*

ing) he was enabled to construct certain curious ves- 
sels, Citlled in the vernacular tongue, steam-boats. 

7 Now these steam-boais were cunningly con- 
trived) and had abundance of curious workmanship 
therein, such as surpassed the comprehension ol' all 
the wise men of the east} from the beginning to this 
day. 

8 Howbeit, they were fashioned somewhat like 
unto the first vessel that floated upon the waters, 
which was the ark of Noah| the ninth descendant 
from Adam ; 

9 /Vnd that they might heat the water which pro- 
duced the steam, there was a fiery furnace placed 
in the midst of the vessels, and the smoke issued 
from the tops thereof. 

10 Moreover, they had. as it were, wheels within 
wheels: and they moved fast upon <he waters, eveM 
against tha wind ana the tide. 

1 1 And they first began to move upon the great 
river Hudson, passing to and fro, from New- York 
to Albany, in the north, conveying the people hither 
and thither in safety. >'" f* 

12 But when the scoffers, the enemies of P'ulton, 
and the gainsayers, saw that the boati moved plea- 
santly upon the river, they began to be a^humed of 
their own ignorance and stupidity, and were fain to 
get into the bouts themselves ; after which, instead 
of laughing, they gaped at the inventor with ^oti« 
ishmtnt. II^?'?* ■

wore pleased with the thing, inasmuch as they di-

1 4 So a vessel was built to carry the destroying 
engines, even a steam frigate, and they called the 
name thereof Fulton the First ; 

15 And certain skilful men were appointed com- 
ini<^sioners to construct this new and dreadful engine 

• of destruction. 

16 And Samuel, a philosopher, sir-named Mitchel, 
a citizen of New-York, was one of the commis- 

' sioners; also, Rutgers, and Morris, and VVolcot, and 

Dearborn, were oiher commissioners ; and they all 

gave their services freely for the good of their cuun- 

ti*y 

Vl7 Now she was equipped with thirty of the en- 

' gines of destruction ; and the weight of a ball that 
they vomited forth was about a thousand siiekels. . 

18 And, when the movement of the frigate was 
fteen on the river> she was as a strong floating hj^* 
tery upon the waters, terrible as death. 

19 Atid'the leni^th thereof was about an hundred 
cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : 

20 Moreover, as they had no gophar-wood^ they 
built the vessel partly of the locust-tree, and partly 
of the majestic oak that fiourishes iu the extensive 
forests of Columbia. . > 

2t But it came to pass, when the whe men and 
the people of Hriiaii>h«ard of this steam frigate, they 
were s* izsd with astonishment and fright ; inasmuch 
as it became a monster in their ima.ginutions. 

22 And they spake concerning it, saying, Lo!

been invented by those cunning Yankees, is abot*t 
two hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof an huu**

great ; and the weight of a bah wltich she voiniteth 
foi'ih, is abuut a thousand five hundred two score and 
ten shekels : 

24 Moreover, said they, she is prepared to cast 
forth scalding water in showers iipon the servants of 
the king, which will deform their countenances and 
spoil their beauty ; '' 

'J5 Likewise, they have prej^arcd her with two- 
edged swords, which, by means of the sieam of thft 
vessel, issue like li|^htning out of her sides. 

26 And now, also, the cunninj:; and witchcraft of 
these Yankees, these sons ot liclial, these caiidren 
of lieeizebub. have invented another instrument of 
destruction) more subtle than all the rest : ' 

W7 Yea, these are mighty evil things, and they 
are c died torpedoes, which may be said to signify 
sleeping devils ; which come, as a thief in the night;^ 
to destroy the servants of the king; and were con* 
trived by that arch fiend, who? ^ name was Fulton. 

28 Now these wonderful torpedoes were made 
partly of brass and partly of iron, and were cunning- 
ly contrived with curious works, like unto a clock ; 
and as it were a large ball. • x^ 

29 And, after they were prepared, and a great 
quantity of the black dust put therein, they were let 
down into the water, nigh unto the strong shipS} 
with intent to destroy thenfi ; ■ * '^i$f^.: 

SO And it was so, that when they struck against 
the ^ottom of the ship, the black dust in the torpedo 
would catch fire, an I buist forth witn tremendous 
roar, casting the vessel out of the waters and hur%.t- 
ihg her in twain.

3 1 Now these torpedoes were brouj^hl into prac- 
tice duriiij^ the war, aUhough the war ceased before 
they did that destruciien to the enemies of Colum- 
bia, for which they were intended. 

32 However, a certain nr>an of courage and enter-

torpedoes, and put it into the waters of the deep, 
at c< pl^ce called Lyn-Huv( n Bay, at ihe mouth of

of Norfolk, in the stale of Virginia;

fore it reached the vessel, and it burst asunder in the 
Vaters with a tremendous noise ;

fare, saying a Verily, this is a foul fashion of fight-

the advantage of us; and the thing is new unto us.

market-men and the fishermen : howbeit, thejr were 
sometimes entrapped. 

25 For it came to pass, upon a certain day, that 
the Poictiers, a mighty ship of the king, lying at a 
place called Sandy-Hook, sent out one of her ten- 
ders, even the Eagle, in search of this kind of plun- 
der: 

26 Whereupon, a fishing boat of Columbia, called 
the Yankee, under the direction of a chief captain 
called Lewis,* prepared herself with a number of 
men to entrap the Eagle. 

37 So they took a fatted calf, a bleating Iamb, and 
a noisy goose, and placed them upon the deck of 
the boat ; and when the servants of the king came 
nigh the Yankee, thinking they were about to be 
treated handsomely with the good things of the land 
of Columbia* their hearts were rejoiced ; 

38 And they commanded the vessel called the Yan- 
kee to follow after them, towards the ship of the king, 
their master ; but at this moment the men of Colum- 
bia arose up from their hiding-places in the hold of 
the boat* and shot into the vessel of Britain. 

29 At the sound of which they were so astonish- 
ed, that they forgot to put the match to the black dust 
of the huge howitzer, a desructive engine made of 
brass, which they had prepared to destroy the men 
of Columbia. 

30 So they were confused, and surrendered the 
£agle up to the Yankee. .^ .

that befel them in the land of Colunabia, they were 
troubled in their minds. 

2 And as they had made what thc^ called a de-

of making another demonstration in the south. 

3 (Now the true sigi»ification, in the vernacular 
tongue, of this word demonstration, had always been 
familiar to the children of Columbia ; but the new 
interpretation, althowgh it wounded the pride of Bri-

7 Had arrived with his army at New-Orleans, he 
"began to fortify the place, for he had heard it noisgd 
abroad that the king was bent upon taking the city. 

8 About this time, Jackson communed with Clai- 
borne the governor, touching the matter ; and as his 
men of war were but few, the valiant husbandmen 
of Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, and the Missis- 
sippi Territory, were informed of the evil, and ac- 
cordingly they flocked in multitudes to the banners

day of the same month, that a fighting vessel of the 
United States, called the Caroline, commanded by 
Daniel, was set fire to, and blown up, by the heated 
balls of the king's fiery furnace. 

20 On the next day, the whole host of Britain

went against the strong hold of Jackson. 

21 But Jackson let the destroying engines loose 
"Upon the servants of Britain; and compelled them to 
return to their encampments with great loss, even an 
hundred and two score. /■ 

22 Nevertheless, on the first day of the first month* 
©f the eighteen hundred and fifteenth year, the men 
of war of Britain came again, and strove to dislodge

23 At this tinje there arrived to the aid of Jack- 
son about two tl^ousand five hundred valiant men, 
from the back' woods of Keniucky. 

24 Disappointed in their expectations, and falsing 
in their attempts to discomfit the army of Columbia,

selves in their might, to go against the hold of Jack- 
son with th. ir whole force.

Columbia, which lieih to the south ;

6 So, early in the morning, they appeared before 
the camp of the men of Columbia, even the strong 
hold which Jackson, the chief captain, had fortified,

glittered in the sun, and the movement of their 
squadrons was as the waving of a wheat-fiield, >vhen

S The fierceness of their coming was as the com- 
ing of a thousand untamed lions, which move ma- 
jestically over the sandy deserts of Arabia. 

9 And the army rested upon the plains of Mac 
Prardies, nigh unto the cypress swump, being dis- 
tant from the ciiy ahout forty and ei^hl furlongs. 

10 Ai d it was aboni ilie rising of the sun, when 
the battenng-rams of the king began to utter their 
noises ; and tlie sound thereof was terrible as the 
roarhig of lions, or the voice of many thunders. 

1 1 Moreover, they cast forth bombs, ai.d Con- 
greve rockets, weapons of destruction, which were 
not known m the days of Jehoshaphat. 

12 Nevertheless, the soul of Jackson failed him 
not, neither was he dismayed, for he was t ntreiichcd 
round about ; and when he raised his hand, be held 
every man*s heart therein. 

13 And Jackson spake, and sai5 unto his captains 
of fifties, and his captains of hundreds. Fear not ; 
■we defend our lives and our lioerty, and in that thing 
the Lord will not forsake us : 

14 Therefore, let every man be upon his watch ; 
and let the destroying engines now utter forth their 
thunders in abundance : 

15 And ye cunning back-woodsmen, who have 
known only to hunt the squirrel, the wolf, and the 
deer, now pour forth your strength upon the mighty 
lion, that we may not be overcome

18 Twice did the host of Pritain,in solid columns,

twice he drove them back. 

19 Moreover, Daniel the brave, who had raised 
up defences opOn the banks of the river, likewise let 
his engines loose upon them, and shot into the camp 
of the king. 

20 And the men of Britain strove to scale the 
ramparts, and get into the strong hold of Jackson ; 
but the husbandmen drove them back with great 
slaughter. 

2 1 The fire and the smoke, and the deafning 
noise that sbuuded along the battlements, were tre- 
naendous for more than the space of two hours, 
when the dreadful roarings ceased, for the warriors 
of the king fled in confusion.

ued his system of robbery, 

3 And here, with the strong ships of Britain, he 
captured a town called St. Marys, in the state of 
Georgia; and, among other evils, he stole away the 
sable sons of Ethiopia, 

4 And conveyed them to the island of Bermuda, 
of which the king had made him chief governor, and 
sold them, after promisip.g them liberty and free- 
dom. 

5 However, it came to pass about this time, that 
the news of peace being made between the nations 
aruived in the land of Columbia : 

6 For it had happened that the grea Sanhedrim, 
in their wisdom, hud sent out Henry, su'uamed Clay,

1) For it came to pass, th:rt the generous media- 
Uon offered by ihe emperor of Knssia was refused 
by the council of nritain, who had not yielded to tho 
voice of accommodation. 

U) So, when the uiinistcrs of the two nations were 
inr't, they communed a long tinie with one another, 
touching the matter ;

12 Nevertheless, in process of time, the wise men 
of Britain waved their demands, and agreed to the 
dine qua non given to them by the commissioners of 
Columbia. 

13 So a treaty of peace was made and signed by 
the commissioners of btJth parties, on the twenty and

and saw no hope of con([ucring the sons of liberty. 

15 After which it was sent from Britain, across 
the mighty deep, about three thousand miles, to re- 
ceive the sanction of the free people of Columbia. 

16 And the great Sanhedrim of the people exa- 
mined the treaty, and it was accepted and confirmed 
by them on the seventeenth day of the second month, 
in the eighteen htmdred and fifteenth year. 

17 After which it was ratified and signed with the 
hand- writing of James, the chief governor of the 
land of Columbia, and published to the world. 

18 Tlius was a stop put to the shedding of humatl 
blood ; and the noise of the destroying engines sunk 
down into silence, and every man returned to his 
own home in peace. 

19 Now when it was known for a certainty that 
peace was made between the nations, the people 
throughout the land were rejoiced beyond measure. 

20 Ahd when the news thereof was spread abroady 
the temples of the Lord were opened, and the peo- 
ple of Columbia praised God for his goodness yea» 
th^.y thanked him that he had strengthened their 
arms, un(i delivered them from tlie paw of the lioi). 

21 Ihus did the chiUh'en of Columbia praise the 
Lord in the strength of their youth, and in the days 
of their prosperity ; not waiting till the cold and pal- 
sied hand ot age had made them iet:ble, and robbed 
their prayers of half their virtue. 

22 Hciceforih may the nations of the earth learn 
wis'.io.n : then sha.l peace become triumphant, and

beaten into piougshareS) and their speurs turned in-

34 Hutt nevertheless, if this war, like all other 
wars, brought evil upon the sons of men, it demon- 
strated to the world, that the people of Columbia 
ivere able to defend themselves, single-handed, 
against one of the strongest powers of Europe. 

25 And the mighty kings and potentates of the 
earth shall learn, from this example of Republican

and set in motion their loud pealing belis. that sound*

^ OW it came to pass, that while the war raged 
between the people of Columbia and the kingdom of 
Great tirituin, other evils rose up in the east. 

3 For the people who inhabited the coast of Bar^ 
bary, even the Algerines, committed great depre- 
dations upon the commerce of Columbia; ,,' , i,r 

3 Inasmuch as they captured tlieir merchant ves« 
scls, and held the men of Columbia who wrought 
therein in cruel bondage. r^iv' ^ •„ - .-* 

4 Now these Algerines, who were barbarians, 
dwelt upon the borders of the great sea called the 
r^Icditerranean, in the" way journeying towards the 
Garxlefi of Edeuy the cradle of the world ; even Par- 
adise, where stood the tree of good and evil, and 
where the great river Euphrates emptieth its waters 
into the Gulph of Persia, which lieth about six thou- 
sand six hundred and sixty-six miles to the eust of 
Washington, the chief city of the land of Columbia. 

o Moreover, the waters of this great sea washed

•where the children of Uracl were held in buiid.igc

6 Nevertheless, the manifold evils which these 
barbarians committed, by the instigation of Satan 
"ivithin them, or by bcin^j led astray by the enen/ns 
of Columbiy, raised the voice of the great Sanhe- 
drim against them. 

7 For they had violated tlie treaty which the peo- 
ple of Columbia had made with them in youd fuiih, 
and set it at nought. 

8 Now it had curiously happened, that throvigh 
fear or folly all the nations of the earth had alwuys 
accustomed themselves to pay tribute to these bar- 
barians ; . ■ . • . . 

9 But the people of Columbia were the fir^t to 
break the charm, with their brave captains and their 
destroying engines, many years ago.* 

10 Ilowbeit, they were now again compelled to 
go against them, and strive to bring them to a sense 
of justice, if not by pcrsuaiion, by communications 
from the mouths of their destroying engines. 

1 1 So it came to pass, on the third day of the third 
month, in the one thousand eight hundred and fif- 
teenth veur of the Christian era, 

12 That the great Siinhedrim of the people sent 
forth a decree, making war upon the people of Al-

13 After which, the fleet of Columbia* which had 
been increased by the folly of Brituiii, was prepared 
to go atjainst them ; and the gallant Decatur was 
made chief captian thereof. 

14 The number of the strong vessels was about 
half a score, and the names of the mightiest amongst 
them were called the Guerriere, the Macedoniani 
and the Constellation. ^ 

15 Now the name of the first of these tall ships 
was after a strong ship of the king of Britaini which 
was taken by the brave Hull, and burnt upon the 
Waters and the Macedonian was also taken from 
Britain by Stephen, sirnamed Decatur : 

16 And whtn they came into the waters of Eu- 
rope, the men of Britain* gnashed their teeth witli 
V' xation, neither would they behold them, but ihey 
turned their backs, for iheir pride was wounded, 
whilst the surroundintj nations bciicid the fleet with 
astonishment. 

17 ^^3vv it was on the eighteenth day of the fifth 
month, in the same year, iu the after part of the day, 
that the fli;ct of Coknnbia spread their wings to the 
western breeze, and sailed from the haven of New- 
York ; 

18 \nd, with Decatur, the chief captairv, in th© 
Guerriere, they bade farewell to the land of Colum- 
bia ; and the shouts of the people made the welkia 
rinu;, and iheir blessings followed after them.

diterranean sea, being only thirty days after he left 
the land of Columbia, 

20 That he fell in with one of the strongest fight- 
ing ships of these barbarians, called the Misodu, and 
he followed after ber, and in less than the space of 
half an hour after letting his destroying engines loose 
upon her, he took her captive, with five hundred 
men that were in her, 

21 And thirty of the barbarians were slain, among 
"whom was their chief captain, whom they called Rais 
Hammida ; besides many were wounded, and about 
four hundred prisoners were taken; but Decatur 
had not a man killed. 

22 Moreover, on the second day afterwards, the 
fleet of Columbia captured another fighting vessel 
of the Algerines : 

23 And the slain that were found on board being 
numbered, were twenty and three, and the prisoners 
were four score : howbiit, there were none of ihe 
people of Columbia even maimed. Thus was the 
navy of Columbia triumphant in the east, as it had 
been in the west. 

24 Now these things happened nigh unto a place 
called Carthagena, on the borders of Spain ; and 
when the Spaniards beheld the skill and prowess of 
the people ol Columbia, they were amazed. 

25 Immediately after this, Decatur departed, and 
went with his fleet to the port of Algiers, the chief 
city of the barbarians, lying on the borders of Af- 
rica. 

26 But when their rulfM' beheld the star-spangled 
banners of Columbia, he trembled at the aspcn-leiif ;

27 And Decatur demanded the men of Columbia, 
without ransom, who were held in bondage; and 
ten thousand pieces of silver, for the evils they had 
committed against the people of Columbia : and the 
Dey had three hours to answer him yea, or nay. 

28 However, he quickly agreed to the propositions 
of Decatur ; and he paid the money, and sign'^d the 
treaty which Decatur had prepared for him, and de- 
livered up all the men of Columbia whom he held as 
slavvs. 

29 And the treaty was confirmed at Washington, 
the chief city, and signed by James, the chief go- 
vernor, on the twtnty and sixlli day of the twelfth 
month, in the same year : and Decatur generously 
made a pre sent of the ship Misoda to the Dty. 

30 Now it catne to pass, after Decatur had set- 
tled the peace with the Dey of /Mj^ierA. according 
to his wishes, that he sailed against another town of 
the barbarians, called Tunis. 

31 For the governor of this place, who is called 
the Bey, had permitted great evils to b<(:,comm.ittcd 
against the people of Columbia, by the ships of Bri- 
tain, during the late war ; inasmuch as they let them 
come into their waters, and take away the vessels of 
Columbia that were prizes. 

52 So. for these depredations, the gallant Decatur 
demamled forty thtmsand pieces of silver, which, 
after a short deliberation, the Bey was fain to grant, 
lest, peradventure, his city might, from the force of 
the destroying engines, begin to tumble about his 

r 

ears. -ji '

m From the port of Tunis, Decatur departed 
and went to a place called Tripoli, which liclh lo 
the south thereof, where the bnive Eaton* fought^ 
and erected the banners of Columbia upon the walls 
of Derne. 

34 Now the chief governor of the Tripolitans, 
whom they called the BaHhuw, had sufl'end like 
evils to be done by the British in his dominions 
which had been permitted by the Bey of Tunis. 

33 So likewise, for these evils Decatur dcmatulcd 
thirty thousand pieces of silver, but at first the Ba- 
shaw refused to p;vy it. 

36 However, when he saw the strong ships of Co- 
lumbia were about to destroy the town, lie paid the 
money, save a little, which he was unable to get, and 
for wliich Decatur compelled him to release ten cap- 
tives of other nations, whom he held in bondajjc. 

37 Thus did Decatur, and his brave men in the 
same year, compel tht- powers of Barbury to respect 
the banners of Columbia. 

38 Now, having accomplished the object of his 
expedition, he returned, encircled with glory, to the 
land of Columbia : 

39 And all the people were rejoiced with great 
joy, and they made feasts for him, and extolled his 
name.' 

40 Moreover, ilie great Sanhedrim of tbe people 
honoret. him for his gallant exphnts, and gave unto
