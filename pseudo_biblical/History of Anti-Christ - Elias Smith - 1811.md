History of Anti-Christ.

BOOK I.

CHAPTER I.

1 AND it came to pass in those days, that Mary, the wife of Joseph, a carpenter of Galilee, being at Bethlehem, brought forth her first born son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger in that town, because there was no room for them in the inn.

2 And when her child was born, there was a general movement in heaven, earth and hell; for as soon as he was born, the angels came from heaven to worship him as the Christ their King,

3 And it came to pass that one of the angels told the shepherds of Bethlehem the news of his birth, which caused all their hearts to rejoice.

4 Then all the heavenly hosts rejoiced with the angel, saying glory to God In the highest, on earth peace, good will towards men.

5 Then said the shepherds let us go to Bethlehem, and know the truth of what the angel hath told us.

6 Then came they to Bethlehem, and found the babe and his mother; and they worshipped him, and returned to their flocks with exceeding great joy.

7 And it came to pass that when the wise men of the earth saw a new star, they came to Jerusalem to enquire for him who was called the Christ, and to know the place of his birth.

8 Then said the chief men of Jerusalem, Bethlehem is the place of his birth, according to the writings of the Prophets ; (howbeit they went not with the wise men, neither did they rejoice that Christ was born.)

9 Now it came to pass in the same year (being the year of the reign of Caesar Augustus) that another child was born, who, on account of his having an opposite temper from Christ was called Anti-Christ.

10 (Now Anti-Christ signifieth against Christ, or one who wisheth his destruction.)

11 And it came to pass that when Anti-Christ was but a child, he began to act according to the meaning of his name, for as soon as he began to speak he said, come let us destroy this child called Christ, for it is not for my interest or honor for him to live.

12 Then Anti-Christ (though but a child) sent forth cruel men like himself, and slew all the children in the town where it was said Christ was born, that Christ might not escape.

13 Howbeit Christ having many friends, was preserved from the rage of Anti-Christ, by being carried by his parents into Egypt.

14 And Anti-Christ having (as he thought) destroyed his adversary, appeared peaceable for almost thirty years.

15 And at the end of about thirty years, Christ, who had been concealed from all, excepting a few of his friends, made a public appearance at the river Jordan, where the multitude who saw him were filled with astonishment.

16 Now the manner of his appearance was this--John, the son of a Jewish high priest was sent to begin a new dispensation, which Christ was the author of; and to baptize in the river Jordan, those who believed what he preached.

17 And it was said unto John, the person on whom the Holy Ghoft shall descend like a dove, the same is the Christ ; and so it was, that Christ, coming up out of the water, the Holy Ghoft descended like a dove, and sat upon him.

18 And after this there came a voice, saying, this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.

19 Now when this was noised abroad, Anti-Christ was much alarmed, and all his old troubles revived again, and he said, what meaneth this? and he called together his friends and said unto them.

20 (Now Anti-Christ at this time for want of experience was not qualified to oppose Christ, only he was born and possessed malice in his heart against him.)

21 Is this the Christ whom I thought was slain in Bethlehem many years ago ? Then answered some of his friends and said, this is indeed the very Christ.

22 Now when Anti-Christ had heard this, he was troubled, and all his friends with him; and they adopted a federal system, which was to say one thing and do another, and to make the people think that the reason why they opposed Christ was, because they were such friends to religion and the government.

23 (Now their federal system was this, to endeavor to keep up their reputation among the people by making them believe they were not fit to rule themselves, and that if they believed in Christ, the government would soon be in the hands of the Romans.)

24 Moreover Anti-Christ and his friends agreed to use all their influence to prevent the people from hearing Christ, and to bring something against him, to prove him worthy of death.

25 And Anti-Christ: called together all those who professed the spirit of Anti-Christ, and said unto them.

26 (Now the heads of them who had entered into an agreement against Christ, were the Chief Priests, the Scribes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Lawyers, and the Herodians, with their disciples.)

27 Let us endeavor to prove that this Christ is an enemy to our established religion, and that he speaks against Moses and our temple:

28 Moreover let us represent him as an enemy to the government by saying to the people that this Christ calleth himself a king; for whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar; for if this can be done, we shall have wherewith to prove that he ought to die.

29 And when Anti-Christ had done speaking, they all with one voice approved of his speech, and Anti-Christ sent forth some of his disciples to entangle him in his talk.

30 But Christ being acquainted with their wickedness, answered them in such a manner that they were astonished, and durst not ask him any more questions.

31 And when Anti-Christ saw that he could not accomplish his design in this way, he called together his friends, and said unto them, you see that ye prevail nothing, behold the world is gone after him, and if we let him alone there will be none left to call us Rabbi.

32 Moreover all the people are attentive to hear him, and besides this though we make such a splendid appearance in Moses seat, and he appeareth to mean, preaching in boats and in the mountain, yet the common people are much better pleased with his preaching than they are with ours.

33 Then answered one of the company and said unto them, let us endeavor to make the people believe that this Christ is a deceiver, and that if they leave us to hear him, it will bring a curse upon our holy nation and temple.

34 So they told the people that he was mad and had a devil, and that he cast out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils.

35 Then said the people these are not the words of a devil; can a man that hath a devil preach such doctrine as this ?

36 Then Anti-Christ answered and said unto the people, ye are this fellow's disciples, we are Moses disciples, we know that God spake unto Moses, but as for this fellow, we know not whence he is.

37 Now when Anti-Christ had left off speaking to the people, he withdrew himself from them and thus addressed his companions; ye see that all we say answers no purpose, for the people are determined to follow this Christ, and unless we can prevent it, our cause must fall to the ground.

38 And he said unto them, arguments prevail nothing with the people, let us kill him and then shall we have rest, and the people will obey us; and to this they all
agreed.

39 And from that day forward they sought how they might take him, and they said let us take him on the feast day, least there be an uproar among the people, and so
the blame come on us, which we wish the people to think ought to come on Christ.

CHAPTER II.

1 And it came to pass in those days that one of the traitorous disciples of Christ, who knew that Anti-Christ was waiting for an opportunity to kill him, went unto him and said,

2 What will ye give me to deliver him into your hands ? and they agreed with him that he should deliver him into their hands for thirty pieces of silver.

3 And when this was done, he sought an opportunity to take him, and he received a band of soliders and became captain over them.

4 Then Anti-Christ answered and said this is according to our wishes, for now he will be delivered unto us by one of own friends who must think him a deciever, or he would not have sold him into our hands.

5 Now it was so that Christ met with his disciples one evening in a garden, and Judas came, and said, hail master, and kissed him, and after a few words he was led away to the palace of Anti-Christ, where he had all the abusive treatment they could give him.

6 And when Anti-Christ had examined him, he asked those of his company what they thought of the prisoner, and they all with one voice answered, he is worthy of death.

7 Then Anti-Christ answered them and said, though Christ deserves to die, being a blasphemer, yet as I have not that power which I want, and mean to have before I die, it is not lawful for me to put him to death.

8 Then Anti-Christ brought him before the Governor, and said, we have found this fellow perverting our nation, and stirring up the people against us, who only have a right to rule the people.

9 Now when the Governor had examined him, he said, I find no fault in him, I will chastise him, and let him go.

10 But Anti-Christ said if thou let this man go, thou art no friend to the government; (now Anti-Christ was a friend to that government which favoured his cause, whether it was just or unjust.)

11 Then said the Governor, take ye him and put him to death, though I find nothing in him worthy of death.

12 And it came to pass that when the Governor had spoken these words, Anti-Christ and all his company rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said one to another, see what an excellent purpose our federal system connected with our perseverance has answered.

13. And when morning came, they took him and lead him to mount Calvary to crucify him, hoping that this would be an end to their troubles.

14 Now when Christ was on the cross, Anti-Christ and those who were his kindred reviled him, for his pretending to be the Christ.

15 And about the ninth hour Christ cried with a loud voice to his Father, and gave up the ghost! and the rocks rent! and the graves were opened! and the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom!!

16 And it came to pass that after these things, two of Christ's disciples obtained leave of the Governor to take his body and bury it in a new tomb.

17 (Now Christ had told his friends that he should die, and that he should rise again the third day.)

18 And it came to pass that after he was buried, Anti-Christ spake unto the Governor and said, we remember that that deceiver said when he was alive, that he should rise again, and if his disciples should come and steal him and make this report, we shall be in a worse situation than we are now.

18 Now when the Governor heard this, he gave them orders to seal the seuplchre, and set a watch to prevent his disciples from stealing him away.

20 And it came to pass that on the third day after his death, there came an angel from heaven to the
sepulchre, and when the watch saw him, they became as dead men, and the angel rolled away the stone from the sepulchre, and Christ arose from the dead, to the great joy of the angel.

21 And when this was done, the soldiers ran into the city and told the news to Anti-Christ and his friends, and when they heard this, they were filled with amazement, and communed together, saying, what shall we do.

22 Then Anti-Christ said, let us give the soldiers large sums of money to lie for us, and to say the disciples stole him away while we slept, (now they thought it more to their honor and interest to hire the soldiers to lie for them, than it was to do it themselves for nothing.)

23 And when this was told to the soldiers, they answered and spake to Anti-Christ and said, if the Governor hear that we slept, we shall surely die.

24 But Anti-Christ answered and said unto them, we will secure you from any harm in this way, so they took the money and did as they were commanded; (they first told the truth to Anti-Christ without reward, and reported a lie from him for hire.)

25 And this saying was reported as a fact for many years, that the disciples of Christ came by night and stole him away while the soldiers slept.

CHAPTER III.

1 Now it came to pass, after these things, that Christ shewed himself to his disciples after his resurrection, and comforted their hearts in their troubles.

2 And forty days after his resurrection, he commanded his ministers to declare the power of his resurrection to all the world.

3 Now it came to pass that when he had given them commandment, he ascended up to heaven, to the great joy of the angels, and his disciples.

4 And being received by his Father, he sat down with him his throne to reign forever.

5 Now it came to pass that ten days after his ascension, he sent down his spirit to assist his ministers in performing what he had commanded them.

6 And as they began to speak to the people, there came such a visible power on them, that great multitudes believed that Christ was risen from the dead.

7. Now it came to pass that Christ's ministers not only preached with power; but they wrought miracles that filled all the people with astonishment.

8 (For a lame man was healed, and walked, and leaped, and praised God.)

9 And when Anti-Christ saw what was done, he was grieved, and all his friends with him, and said unto them,

10 Let us take these men and imprison them until we conclude what to do with them, (for it was now even tide.)

11 And it came to pass on the morrow that Anti-Christ called together his servants, friends, and relations, and said unto them,

12 (Now those who were with Anti-Christ were the high Priests, the Captain of the Temple, the Sadducees, the Rulers, the Elders, and the Scribes.)

13 These men have done a notable miracle, and we cannot deny it; but that it proceed no further, let us charge them that they speak no more in this name.

14 Then they called them, and charged them never to mention the name of Christ in that city; but they told them that they should obey their own king.

15 Now it came to pass that after these things there was one Stephen, a faithful friend of Christ, who disputed with Anti-Christ's friends and overcame them.

16 And because they could not withstand him, they privately engaged men to hurt his character and to say that they had heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and the most high God.

17 When this came to Anti-Christ's ears he said these things are so, and though Stephen proved what he spoke, yet they put him to death by stoning him with stones.

18 Now when this was done, the friends of Christ were scattered abroad, and went every where preaching Christ.

19 Then was Anti-Christ glad that those who troubled their Israel were departed from them; but when he heard that other cities had received them, and that many believed on Christ through them--

20 He sent a young many by the name of Saul, to bring all the friends of Christ bound to Jerusalem, to be examined before Anti-Christ.

21 And as he went on his way, Christ met him, and said unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me! and as he spake he shot an arrow which overcome him so that he fell to the ground.

22 After this he became an hearty friend of Christ, and faithfully preached his doctrine in the world.

23 Now when Anti-Christ heard this, he and all his friends were much cast down in their own eyes; for they were convinced that Christs power was above theirs.

24 And Anti-Christ called together his friends and said unto them, ye see that notwithstanding all our opposition to Christ, yet his kingdom is increasing, and ours is decreasing.

25 Let us choose faithful men, and send into all places where Christ is preached, to oppose them, and to stir up the people against them.

26 Then they sent them forth, and they stirred up the people, and the rulers against them, and they whipped them, and imprisoned many, and many they put to death.

27 Yet notwithstanding all the cruelties inflicted on them by Anti-Christ, they increased the more.

28 And when Anti-Christ saw that he prevailed nothing by this plan, he called together all those who had adopted the federal system, and said unto them,

29 Ye see that our federal plan turns against us; let us now engage the doctrine which Christ's disciples preach to the world, for if we can destroy that, those who embrace it must come to nothing: and to this they all agreed.

CHAPTER IV.

1 Now it came to pass that when Anti-Christ began to be about sixty years of age, he went out to war against the doctrine of Christ, which his disciples preached.

2 And he said let us first overthrow the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, for if this can be done, we shall prove that Christ is not risen, and that Paul's preaching is vain, and that he is a false witness.

3 Then began many of Anti-Christ's most able followers to prove that when men died, that was a final end of them.

4 Now when this was done, Paul was stirred in spirit and said unto his brethren and to those who opposed his doctrine, this doctrine of the resurrection is true.

5 And by reafon of the arguments which he brought in favor of it, he established his brethren, and put to silence those who opposed the doctrine.

6 (For Paul proved that Christ was the Son of God, and that he had power to raise from the grave those who were dead.)

7 Now it came to pass that when Anti-Christ heard this, he sent to all those who were members of the Federal company, and said unto them,

8 Ye see the new difficulties which arise in our way, for no sooner are we overcome in one thing, but Christ's disciples bring something more in our way.

9 Now when Anti-Christ had left off speaking, there was a great silence among them for the space of half an hour.

10 Then rose up Cerenthius and said unto them, though it is true that Paul teaches that Christ is the Son of God, yet I will pledge my honor that I can bring more arguments against the doctrine than he can for it.

11 Now when he had thus spoken, they all took new courage, hoping that their united exertions would not be in vain.

12 At that time there was one of Christ's disciples called John, who preached that Christ was the Son of God, and proved it from the scriptures and from the miracles which Christ wrought.

13 And Cerenthius said unto him, I am a friend to Christ, yet I am not so much of an idolater as to worship him as the Son of God.

14 Then John answered and said onto him, thou art not a friend to Christ but of Anti-Christ, for every one that doth not confess that Jesus is the Son of God, belongs to Anti-Christ.

15 Now when this was done, John said unto his brethren, let us cast out this Cerenthius, for he is come among us to help Anti-Christ, and to take away our Lord whom
we worship.

16 And they cast him out, notwithstanding all his pretended zeal for the honor of Christ.

17 Now when Cerenthius saw that he was cast out, and that his doctrine was cast out with him, he was filled with wrath and said unto them,

18 I am determined to be revenged on thee for thy cruel treatment, and that my doctrine shall be spread in the world.

19 And he went unto Anti-Christ, and said unto him, these men are endeavoring to overthrow the government, for I have heard them say that Christ is not only the Son of God, but that he is a king, and a great high priest.

20 And they have also said, that as a king, he has all power in heaven and on earth.

21 They likewise say, that Christ will reign 'till he has put all his enemies under his feet, and if this is
true, we must submit among the rest.

22 Now when Antt-Christ heard this, he was filled with aftoniffi- inent, and said unto them that flood by him,
23 The dodrine of Christ has fpread much fafter fincc we begun to oppofe it, than it did when we kiUed hk followers.
￼*8 HISTORY Of
# 24 Let us therefore inform the king concerning this matter, and make him believe that if he does not fall these men, in afliorttime
his kingdom will be overthrown. 25 And Anti-Christ wrote unto
thefang,certifying that there were certain people in his realm, that were hurtful to kings s
26 And that ifhelct them alone, they would neither pay toil, tribute
nor cuftom.
27 Now when this came to the cars of the king, he commanded them all to be {lain.
28 Then said Anti.Christ, our cause now « begins to look up," and they all rejoiced with exceed-
ing great joy,
29 But fo it was, that notwith- Handing they put fo many todeath, yet they incrcafed the more, which caused all the joy of Ami-Chria to be turned into mourning.

€*THE Clergy, who are numerous, and, as a body, very refpcclablc, JIJIVC hitherto preferved a kind of ariitocratical balance In the very dentocraticat government of the ftate 1 which has happily operated as a clieck upon the overbearing
1fpirk of RqwUiciniltn. It has been lamented that the unhappy
religious dtiputcs which have too much prevailed among feme of the Clerpy, and an inattention to the qualifications of thole who haw been admitted to the facred ollcc, have, heretofore, conlderably di- oiiniflicd their influence. It is a pleating clicumfiance that the rage for theological difputation is abat- ing 1 and greater ftriftnefi is ob* ferved in the admiflion of candi- dates to the miniflry.

Ririors^ Teachers, I T , In book* concerning law, wc may find a daft of men called the Clergy. What zm they ? They arc properly fpiritual
rulers ; or, according to the Englifh tcrmv Lords fpiritual! or lords over men's fouls. What qualifies a per-
