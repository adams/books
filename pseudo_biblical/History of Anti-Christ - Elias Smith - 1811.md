History of Anti-Christ.

BOOK I.

CHAPTER I.

1 AND it came to pass in those days, that Mary, the wife of Joseph, a carpenter of Galilee, being at Bethlehem, brought forth her first born son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger in that town, because there was no room for them in the inn.

2 And when her child was born, there was a general movement in heaven, earth and hell; for as soon as he was born, the angels came from heaven to worship him as the Christ their King,

3 And it came to pass that one of the angels told the shepherds of Bethlehem the news of his birth, which caused all their hearts to rejoice.

4 Then all the heavenly hosts rejoiced with the angel, saying glory to God In the highest, on earth peace, good will towards men.

5 Then said the shepherds let us go to Bethlehem, and know the truth of what the angel hath told us.

6 Then came they to Bethlehem, and found the babe and his mother; and they worshipped him, and returned to their flocks with exceeding great joy.

7 And it came to pass that when the wise men of the earth saw a new star, they came to Jerusalem to enquire for him who was called the Christ, and to know the place of his birth.

8 Then said the chief men of Jerusalem, Bethlehem is the place of his birth, according to the writings of the Prophets ; (howbeit they went not with the wise men, neither did they rejoice that Christ was born.)

9 Now it came to pass in the same year (being the year of the reign of Caesar Augustus) that another child was born, who, on account of his having an opposite temper from Christ was called Anti-Christ.

10 (Now Anti-Christ signifieth against Christ, or one who wisheth his destruction.)

11 And it came to pass that when Anti-Christ was but a child, he began to act according to the meaning of his name, for as soon as he began to speak he said, come let us destroy this child called Christ, for it is not for my interest or honor for him to live.

12 Then Anti-Christ (though but a child) sent forth cruel men like himself, and slew all the children in the town where it was said Christ was born, that Christ might not escape.

13 Howbeit Christ having many friends, was preserved from the rage of Anti-Christ, by being carried by his parents into Egypt.

14 And Anti-Christ having (as he thought) destroyed his adversary, appeared peaceable for almost thirty years.

15 And at the end of about thirty years, Christ, who had been concealed from all, excepting a few of his friends, made a public appearance at the river Jordan, where the multitude who saw him were filled with astonishment.

16 Now the manner of his appearance was this--John, the son of a Jewish high priest was sent to begin a new dispensation, which Christ was the author of; and to baptize in the river Jordan, those who believed what he preached.

17 And it was said unto John, the person on whom the Holy Ghoft shall descend like a dove, the same is the Christ ; and so it was, that Christ, coming up out of the water, the Holy Ghost descended like a dove, and sat upon him.

18 And after this there came a voice, saying, this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.

19 Now when this was noised abroad, Anti-Christ was much alarmed, and all his old troubles revived again, and he said, what meaneth this? and he called together his friends and said unto them.

20 (Now Anti-Christ at this time for want of experience was not qualified to oppose Christ, only he was born and possessed malice in his heart against him.)

21 Is this the Christ whom I thought was slain in Bethlehem many years ago? Then answered some of his friends and said, this is indeed the very Christ.

22 Now when Anti-Christ had heard this, he was troubled, and all his friends with him; and they adopted a federal system, which was to say one thing and do another, and to make the people think that the reason why they opposed Christ was, because they were such friends to religion and the government.

23 (Now their federal system was this, to endeavor to keep up their reputation among the people by making them believe they were not fit to rule themselves, and that if they believed in Christ, the government would soon be in the hands of the Romans.)

24 Moreover Anti-Christ and his friends agreed to use all their influence to prevent the people from hearing Christ, and to bring something against him, to prove him worthy of death.

25 And Anti-Christ: called together all those who professed the spirit of Anti-Christ, and said unto them.

26 (Now the heads of them who had entered into an agreement against Christ, were the Chief Priests, the Scribes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Lawyers, and the Herodians, with their disciples.)

27 Let us endeavor to prove that this Christ is an enemy to our established religion, and that he speaks against Moses and our temple:

28 Moreover let us represent him as an enemy to the government by saying to the people that this Christ calleth himself a king; for whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar; for if this can be done, we shall have wherewith to prove that he ought to die.

29 And when Anti-Christ had done speaking, they all with one voice approved of his speech, and Anti-Christ sent forth some of his disciples to entangle him in his talk.

30 But Christ being acquainted with their wickedness, answered them in such a manner that they were astonished, and durst not ask him any more questions.

31 And when Anti-Christ saw that he could not accomplish his design in this way, he called together his friends, and said unto them, you see that ye prevail nothing, behold the world is gone after him, and if we let him alone there will be none left to call us Rabbi.

32 Moreover all the people are attentive to hear him, and besides this though we make such a splendid appearance in Moses seat, and he appeareth to mean, preaching in boats and in the mountain, yet the common people are much better pleased with his preaching than they are with ours.

33 Then answered one of the company and said unto them, let us endeavor to make the people believe that this Christ is a deceiver, and that if they leave us to hear him, it will bring a curse upon our holy nation and temple.

34 So they told the people that he was mad and had a devil, and that he cast out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils.

35 Then said the people these are not the words of a devil; can a man that hath a devil preach such doctrine as this ?

36 Then Anti-Christ answered and said unto the people, ye are this fellow's disciples, we are Moses disciples, we know that God spake unto Moses, but as for this fellow, we know not whence he is.

37 Now when Anti-Christ had left off speaking to the people, he withdrew himself from them and thus addressed his companions; ye see that all we say answers no purpose, for the people are determined to follow this Christ, and unless we can prevent it, our cause must fall to the ground.

38 And he said unto them, arguments prevail nothing with the people, let us kill him and then shall we have rest, and the people will obey us; and to this they all
agreed.

39 And from that day forward they sought how they might take him, and they said let us take him on the feast day, least there be an uproar among the people, and so
the blame come on us, which we wish the people to think ought to come on Christ.

CHAPTER II.

1 And it came to pass in those days that one of the traitorous disciples of Christ, who knew that Anti-Christ was waiting for an opportunity to kill him, went unto him and said,

2 What will ye give me to deliver him into your hands ? and they agreed with him that he should deliver him into their hands for thirty pieces of silver.

3 And when this was done, he sought an opportunity to take him, and he received a band of soliders and became captain over them.

4 Then Anti-Christ answered and said this is according to our wishes, for now he will be delivered unto us by one of own friends who must think him a deciever, or he would not have sold him into our hands.

5 Now it was so that Christ met with his disciples one evening in a garden, and Judas came, and said, hail master, and kissed him, and after a few words he was led away to the palace of Anti-Christ, where he had all the abusive treatment they could give him.

6 And when Anti-Christ had examined him, he asked those of his company what they thought of the prisoner, and they all with one voice answered, he is worthy of death.

7 Then Anti-Christ answered them and said, though Christ deserves to die, being a blasphemer, yet as I have not that power which I want, and mean to have before I die, it is not lawful for me to put him to death.

8 Then Anti-Christ brought him before the Governor, and said, we have found this fellow perverting our nation, and stirring up the people against us, who only have a right to rule the people.

9 Now when the Governor had examined him, he said, I find no fault in him, I will chastise him, and let him go.

10 But Anti-Christ said if thou let this man go, thou art no friend to the government; (now Anti-Christ was a friend to that government which favoured his cause, whether it was just or unjust.)

11 Then said the Governor, take ye him and put him to death, though I find nothing in him worthy of death.

12 And it came to pass that when the Governor had spoken these words, Anti-Christ and all his company rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said one to another, see what an excellent purpose our federal system connected with our perseverance has answered.

13. And when morning came, they took him and lead him to mount Calvary to crucify him, hoping that this would be an end to their troubles.

14 Now when Christ was on the cross, Anti-Christ and those who were his kindred reviled him, for his pretending to be the Christ.

15 And about the ninth hour Christ cried with a loud voice to his Father, and gave up the ghost! and the rocks rent! and the graves were opened! and the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom!!

16 And it came to pass that after these things, two of Christ's disciples obtained leave of the Governor to take his body and bury it in a new tomb.

17 (Now Christ had told his friends that he should die, and that he should rise again the third day.)

18 And it came to pass that after he was buried, Anti-Christ spake unto the Governor and said, we remember that that deceiver said when he was alive, that he should rise again, and if his disciples should come and steal him and make this report, we shall be in a worse situation than we are now.

18 Now when the Governor heard this, he gave them orders to seal the seuplchre, and set a watch to prevent his disciples from stealing him away.

20 And it came to pass that on the third day after his death, there came an angel from heaven to the
sepulchre, and when the watch saw him, they became as dead men, and the angel rolled away the stone from the sepulchre, and Christ arose from the dead, to the great joy of the angel.

21 And when this was done, the soldiers ran into the city and told the news to Anti-Christ and his friends, and when they heard this, they were filled with amazement, and communed together, saying, what shall we do.

22 Then Anti-Christ said, let us give the soldiers large sums of money to lie for us, and to say the disciples stole him away while we slept, (now they thought it more to their honor and interest to hire the soldiers to lie for them, than it was to do it themselves for nothing.)

23 And when this was told to the soldiers, they answered and spake to Anti-Christ and said, if the Governor hear that we slept, we shall surely die.

24 But Anti-Christ answered and said unto them, we will secure you from any harm in this way, so they took the money and did as they were commanded; (they first told the truth to Anti-Christ without reward, and reported a lie from him for hire.)

25 And this saying was reported as a fact for many years, that the disciples of Christ came by night and stole him away while the soldiers slept.

CHAPTER III.

1 Now it came to pass, after these things, that Christ shewed himself to his disciples after his resurrection, and comforted their hearts in their troubles.

2 And forty days after his resurrection, he commanded his ministers to declare the power of his resurrection to all the world.

3 Now it came to pass that when he had given them commandment, he ascended up to heaven, to the great joy of the angels, and his disciples.

4 And being received by his Father, he sat down with him his throne to reign forever.

5 Now it came to pass that ten days after his ascension, he sent down his spirit to assist his ministers in performing what he had commanded them.

6 And as they began to speak to the people, there came such a visible power on them, that great multitudes believed that Christ was risen from the dead.

7 Now it came to pass that Christ's ministers not only preached with power; but they wrought miracles that filled all the people with astonishment.

8 (For a lame man was healed, and walked, and leaped, and praised God.)

9 And when Anti-Christ saw what was done, he was grieved, and all his friends with him, and said unto them,

10 Let us take these men and imprison them until we conclude what to do with them, (for it was now even tide.)

11 And it came to pass on the morrow that Anti-Christ called together his servants, friends, and relations, and said unto them,

12 (Now those who were with Anti-Christ were the high Priests, the Captain of the Temple, the Sadducees, the Rulers, the Elders, and the Scribes.)

13 These men have done a notable miracle, and we cannot deny it; but that it proceed no further, let us charge them that they speak no more in this name.

14 Then they called them, and charged them never to mention the name of Christ in that city; but they told them that they should obey their own king.

15 Now it came to pass that after these things there was one Stephen, a faithful friend of Christ, who disputed with Anti-Christ's friends and overcame them.

16 And because they could not withstand him, they privately engaged men to hurt his character and to say that they had heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and the most high God.

17 When this came to Anti-Christ's ears he said these things are so, and though Stephen proved what he spoke, yet they put him to death by stoning him with stones.

18 Now when this was done, the friends of Christ were scattered abroad, and went every where preaching Christ.

19 Then was Anti-Christ glad that those who troubled their Israel were departed from them; but when he heard that other cities had received them, and that many believed on Christ through them--

20 He sent a young many by the name of Saul, to bring all the friends of Christ bound to Jerusalem, to be examined before Anti-Christ.

21 And as he went on his way, Christ met him, and said unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me! and as he spake he shot an arrow which overcome him so that he fell to the ground.

22 After this he became an hearty friend of Christ, and faithfully preached his doctrine in the world.

23 Now when Anti-Christ heard this, he and all his friends were much cast down in their own eyes; for they were convinced that Christs power was above theirs.

24 And Anti-Christ called together his friends and said unto them, ye see that notwithstanding all our opposition to Christ, yet his kingdom is increasing, and ours is decreasing.

25 Let us choose faithful men, and send into all places where Christ is preached, to oppose them, and to stir up the people against them.

26 Then they sent them forth, and they stirred up the people, and the rulers against them, and they whipped them, and imprisoned many, and many they put to death.

27 Yet notwithstanding all the cruelties inflicted on them by Anti-Christ, they increased the more.

28 And when Anti-Christ saw that he prevailed nothing by this plan, he called together all those who had adopted the federal system, and said unto them,

29 Ye see that our federal plan turns against us; let us now engage the doctrine which Christ's disciples preach to the world, for if we can destroy that, those who embrace it must come to nothing: and to this they all agreed.

CHAPTER IV.

1 Now it came to pass that when Anti-Christ began to be about sixty years of age, he went out to war against the doctrine of Christ, which his disciples preached.

2 And he said let us first overthrow the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, for if this can be done, we shall prove that Christ is not risen, and that Paul's preaching is vain, and that he is a false witness.

3 Then began many of Anti-Christ's most able followers to prove that when men died, that was a final end of them.

4 Now when this was done, Paul was stirred in spirit and said unto his brethren and to those who opposed his doctrine, this doctrine of the resurrection is true.

5 And by reafon of the arguments which he brought in favor of it, he established his brethren, and put to silence those who opposed the doctrine.

6 (For Paul proved that Christ was the Son of God, and that he had power to raise from the grave those who were dead.)

7 Now it came to pass that when Anti-Christ heard this, he sent to all those who were members of the Federal company, and said unto them,

8 Ye see the new difficulties which arise in our way, for no sooner are we overcome in one thing, but Christ's disciples bring something more in our way.

9 Now when Anti-Christ had left off speaking, there was a great silence among them for the space of half an hour.

10 Then rose up Cerenthius and said unto them, though it is true that Paul teaches that Christ is the Son of God, yet I will pledge my honor that I can bring more arguments against the doctrine than he can for it.

11 Now when he had thus spoken, they all took new courage, hoping that their united exertions would not be in vain.

12 At that time there was one of Christ's disciples called John, who preached that Christ was the Son of God, and proved it from the scriptures and from the miracles which Christ wrought.

13 And Cerenthius said unto him, I am a friend to Christ, yet I am not so much of an idolater as to worship him as the Son of God.

14 Then John answered and said onto him, thou art not a friend to Christ but of Anti-Christ, for every one that doth not confess that Jesus is the Son of God, belongs to Anti-Christ.

15 Now when this was done, John said unto his brethren, let us cast out this Cerenthius, for he is come among us to help Anti-Christ, and to take away our Lord whom
we worship.

16 And they cast him out, notwithstanding all his pretended zeal for the honor of Christ.

17 Now when Cerenthius saw that he was cast out, and that his doctrine was cast out with him, he was filled with wrath and said unto them,

18 I am determined to be revenged on thee for thy cruel treatment, and that my doctrine shall be spread in the world.

19 And he went unto Anti-Christ, and said unto him, these men are endeavoring to overthrow the government, for I have heard them say that Christ is not only the Son of God, but that he is a king, and a great high priest.

20 And they have also said, that as a king, he has all power in heaven and on earth.

21 They likewise say, that Christ will reign 'till he has put all his enemies under his feet, and if this is
true, we must submit among the rest.

22 Now when Anti-Christ heard this, he was filled with astonishment, and said unto them that stood by him,

23 The doctrine of Christ has spread much faster since we begun to oppose it, than it did when we killed his followers.

24 Let us therefore inform the king concerning this matter, and make him believe that if he does not kill these men, in short time his kingdom will be overthrown. 

25 And Anti-Christ wrote unto the king, certifying that there were certain people in his realm, that were hurtful to kings;

26 And that if he let them alone, they would neither pay toll, tribute nor custom.

27 Now when this came to the ears of the king, he commanded them all to be slain.

28 Then said Anti-Christ, our cause now "begins to look up," and they all rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

29 But so it was, that notwithstanding they put so many to death, yet they increased the more, which caused all the joy of Anti-Christ to be turned into mourning.

30 And Anti-Christ called all his old federal friends together, with all the new members of their company and said unto them,

31 I have one plan more to propose to you as a federal body, which I think will serve to accomplish my wishes.

32 And when they all kept silence, he said unto them I shall mention this plan to you when we meet again.

33 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

History of Anti-Christ

BOOK II.

CHAPTER I.

1 NOW it came to pass when Anti-Christ was about three hundred and thirty-four years old,

2 That he sent forth into all the country round about, and called together the whole federal band, and said unto them,

3 Ye see that I have spent more than three hundred years in endeavoring to overthrow the doctrine and disciples of Christ, and yet I have prevailed nothing:

4 Now therefore hearken unto me, and I will make known unto you the plan which I mentioned when we assembled last.

5 And when they kept silence, he said unto them,

6 The federal plan which I have is this--to endeavor to be as much like Christ and his ministers as we possibly can, and appear to be his friends.

7 Let us first make Rome the seat of our government, as the Emperor has removed his seat of government to Constantinople, and given us an opportunity of establishing ourselves there.

8 Now that this may be done, I must assume the same names which Christ bears, and some of you must be officers under me, as Christ's disciples were under him.

a And he said unto them, Christ is said to be the Image of God, to be a King, a Priest, and a Prophet.

10 He is also called a Bishop of Souls, and head of the Church, and Father of his children, and the Infallible Judge.

11 Moreover he pardons sins, promises a heaven to those who obey him, and a hell for those who will not submit to his government.

12 Anti-Christ said also unto them, if we only take the name which his disciples bear, our federal cause must prosper, for ye know that the foundation of our federalism is to say one thing and do another.

13 Now that we may not fail in our plan, I must be called God upon earth, and a King of kings.

14 I must also have two governments, one temporal and the other spiritual, and I must be king and priest on the throne.

15 I must also be called the universal bishop, and the head of the church, and the father of all who submit to me.

16 And I must also promise heaven to those who are faithful in our cause, and especially those who give money to our church.

17 It will be necessary to mention a hell, and threaten all with eternal damnation that do not obey us; it will be wise in us also to have a place of purgation for departed souls;

18 That those who died in unbelief may be delivered from misery by their rich friends, who may purchase their deliverance.

19 As Christ appointed twelve Apostles, I shall appoint twelve men, to be called their successors.

20 Moreover as Christ appointed other officers, I shall also appoint officers as their successors, and shall call them the Clergy.

21 I shall also conver a number of honorable titles on those who are worthy of them, by being faithful to this federal plan.

22 Now for your encouragement, I will mention some of the titles which you shall wear.

23 Those who are next to me in power shall be called Cardinals, and shall be distinguished by wearing scarlet coloured clothes, & red caps.

24 And those under them shall also be called Lord Archbishops, Archbishops, Lords Spiritual, Right Reverend Fathers in God, Metropolitans, Rectors, Reverend Clergy, Parsons, Curates, Archdeacons, Doctors of Divinity, Professors of Divinity, and many other names equally honorable.

25 Now when Anti-Christ had told them this, he said unto them, this plan mutt be put in execution by little and little.

26 And when Anti-Christ had left off speaking, there was a general shout of joy, which filled all the house where they were sitting.

27 For many of them said, it is the voice of a God, and not of a man; now we are sure that our federal cause will prosper.

CHAPTER II.

1 Now it came to pass after these things, that Anti-Christ removed his seat of government to the city of Rome.

2 And when this was done, he sent out into all the regions round about Rome, and said unto the People, and the disciples of Christ, I am the universal Bishop, and Christ's vicegerent.

3 Then rose up the Bishop of Constantinople, and said unto Anti-Christ, thou art not Christ's vicegerent, neither art thou the universal Bishop.

4 Now it came to pass that when Anti-Christ heard this, he engaged in a war with his opposers, and sent to the King of France, to help him against his enemies.

5 And the battle was sore, yet Anti-Christ overcame his foes, and became the sole possessor of Rome, and the country round about.

6 Now it came to pass that after Anti-Christ had obtained the name of King and universal Bishop, by the help of the king of France, that he said unto him,

7 As a peculiar token of my favor and love, thou and thy successors (as long as they are faithful to me) shall ever be called the eldest son of the church.

8 Now It came to pass that after Anti-Christ had obtained the power which he had ever been seeking after, and had declared himself Christ's vicegerent on earth,

9 That many of Christ's friends were filled with joy, because Anti-Christ had (as they thought) become their friend, and appeared to favor the doctrine of Christ.

10 (Now the reason of this was, they were ignorant of the Federal plan which Anti-Christ and his company had adopted, which was to say one thing and do another.)

11 Now it came to pass that after many years, Anti-Christ begun to exercise his authority over the disciples of Christ, so that many of them doubted whether he was Christ's friend or not.

12 Then answered one of Christ's friends, and said unto Anti-Christ, thou art not a friend to Christ, but thou art still like thy name, against him.

13 Now when he had said this, many believed on him, and rebelled against Anti-Christ, who was endeavoring to overthrow Christ's kingdom, under the pretence of being his friend.

14 And when Anti-Christ saw that they rebelled, he sent forth men to reclaim them from their errors, and to threaten them with death if they did not submit to the laws of Anti-Christ.

15 And they said we will not obey Anti-Christ, for he claims that power which belongs only to Christ.

16 Now when this was done Anti-Christ was filled with rage, and said unto the Federal company let us adopt part of the laws of Moses, by which we may put to death those who transgress our laws.

17 And Anti-Christ and his company agreed on many things mentioned in the law of Moses by which they might kill their enemies, and yet he justified in it from the scriptures.

18 Now these are some of the things which they agreed to--

19 First to erect places of public worship, and call them the houses of God, and his sanctuaries.

20 And Anti-Christ said the temple had an outer court, an inner court, the holy place and the holiest of all.

21 In our temples the outer court shall be called galleries, the inner court we will call pews, the holy place shall be called the deacon's seat, and the holiest of all shall be called the sacred desk.

22 And as no man was allowed to enter into the holiest of all, excepting the high priest, so it shall be a law that no priest shall enter into the sacred desk, unless he is authorized by me, who am God upon earth.

23 And as the high priest wore a breast-plate on his breast, and an ephod, so also those who enter the sacred desk, shall were a breast-plate (or BAND,) and an ephod (or SURPLICE.)

24 Moreover as the law obliged the people to attend at the temple at stated times, so our law shall oblige them to attend public worship in our temples or be punished. 

25 Anti-Christ said unto them, let us also introduce children into our communion, and tell the people that by baptizing them they will be saved.

26 And that those who die without receiving the holy waters will be damned.

27 Now when these laws are in force, those who rebel against us can be put to death, according to
the law, as heretics, who ought to die.

CHAPTER III.

1 Now it came to apss after these things, that Anti-Christ began to exercise his authority over the disciples of Christ, by causing them to be put to death.

2 And when this was done, great multitudes rose up against him and said, we will not have Anti-Christ to reign over us.

3 Then rose up Dominic, and said unto Anti-Chrtft, let us establish an anti-christian court, and call it the court of Inquisition.

4 And let those who are heretics, and all who are suspected of heresy, be brought before the court to be examined, by torturing them, 'till they confess their errors.

5 Now it came to pass, that when this court was established, all who were enemies to Anti-Christ, were brought before the court to be punished (now this was like the modern gag law, which was to prevent the people from speaking the truth.)

6 And this for some time served to promote the federal plan, and to prevent many of Christ's friends from publicly owning him.

7 Now when Anti-Christ saw how beneficial the court of inquisition was to his kingdom, and that he wore out the disciples of Christ by it, he conferred on Dominic the title of Saint, and from that day to this he has been called St. DOMINIC.

8 And after this, the cause of Christ seemed to be on the decline; and Anti-Christ reigned many years undisturbed, having kings at his command.

9 (For he made one king lie under his table while he set at meat; another he caused to hold his stirrup when he mounted his horse; another he caused to kiss his great toe; and others he took their crowns from off their heads; and others he took their crowns from off their heads, 'till they owned that by him king-reigned.)

10 And by reason of the court of inquisition (by which all who were suspected of being enemies to Anti-Christ, were tortured or killed) the number of Christ's disciples became so small, that Anti-Christ concluded he had obtained a complete victory over Christ and his followers.

11 Now when this was done, Anti-Christ gathered together all who were members of the federal body, and said unto them,

12 I have obtained what I once thought I never should, for now my kingdom is established on the ruins of Christ's, and over other kingdoms which are not destroyed, so that they now pay homage to me as their rightful sovereign.

13 Now therefore, as a reward for your faithfulness, I confer on you the titles which I promised many years ago.

14 Then were they all filled with joy when they had received their places of office for life, and they all agreed to be faithful in the federal cause, and to oppose all who rose up against them.

15 And it came to pass in the time of the prosperous reign of Anti-Christ, that many new things were established which had not taken place since the world began.

16 Now these are some of them--Anti-Christ founded a federal company, called monks, who lived in caves; and also a female company, called nuns, who were secluded in cloiester from the world, but not from the federal company.

17 Anti-Christ had also a place called purgatory, where all (except the federal company) were taught that their friends were suffering for their sins, who died without a pardon from Anti-Christ; and that if their friends gave large sums of money to any of this company, they could diliver them from their misery.

18 Anti-Christ and his friends taught the people likewise the importance of praying to Mary, to saints and angels, and that their sins might be pardoned before they were committed, (now this was called indulgence.)

19 There are many things more of this nature, of which we cannot now speak particularly, for if they were all written the world would scarcely contain the books which would be written.

20 But these things are written unto you who believe Anti-Christ is in the world, that you may see the power he once possessed, and how much he has lost; and that he will certainly be destroyed, and the federal plan come to nothing.

CHAPTER IV.
1 And it came to pass by reason of Anti-Christ's pretending to be Christ's vicegerent on earth, and taking away the scripture from the people, that he extended his kingdom over almost the whole world.

2 And by reason of the cruel reign of Anti-Christ, and the wickedness of the clergy which was allowed by Anti-Christ, the whole earth was filled with violence, ignorance, and every kind of cruelty.

3 For even in England the reign of Anti-Christ was so powerful, that the king feared him, and the whole island groaned under their clerical task masters; and their groans reached heaven.

4 And it came to pass that when Anti-Christ was about thirteen hundred and sixty years old, Christ raised up against Anti-Christ one John whose surname was Wickliff,

5 Who appeared to Anti-Christ like Gideon conquering the Midianites, with only a trumpet and a lamp.

6 For he, by preaching and writing, gave such a shock to Anti-Christ and his kingdom, that it has been on the decline from that day to this.

7 (Now at the time when John lived, the money and power was in the hands of the federal clergy, who oppressed the people that were poor and without power to help themselves.)

8 And when this was done, Anti-Christ sought to destroy John who-had discovered his wickedness, and that of the clergy, whom he called proud, worldly, cursed clippers and purse carvers.

9 John also said unto Anti-Christ, that the abomination of desolation had its beginning from a perverse Clergy.

10 At that time, when John saw the wickedness and pride of the federal clergy, he prayed and said,

11 O Lord, what tokens of meekness and forsaking of worldly riches, are these clergymen, pretending to be dead to the world, with the pride and vanity thereof;

12 Yet under this pretence, riding with eighty horses, harnessed with gold and silver, and spending with earls and barons thousands of pounds, to maintain a false plea of the world, and to prevent men from enjoying their rights.

13 Now when he had made this prayer, they being convicted in their own consciences of the truth of these things, sought how they might deftroy him.

14 And for his faithfulness he was brought before Anti-Christ, and accused of heresy, yet he escaped out of their hands, and after writing many books against Anti-Christ, he died in peace.

15 And it came to pass that after his death, his doctrine, (by reason of his books and name) spread in many parts of Anti-Christ's kingdom.

16 So that after he was dead, he did more to destroy Anti-Christ than he did in his life time, which filled all the federal company with madness.

17 Then Anti-Christ sent into all the regions round about, and caused all the books to be burnt, which were written by John, whose surname was Wickliff.

18 Moreover Anti-Christ sent to the clergy in England, forty and four years after John was dead, and ordered his bones to be taken out of the grave and burnt, which was done.

19 And after they had burnt them, they cast the ashes into a brook called Swift, which has its head near Knaptoft, in Leicestershire.

20 Now the rest of the acts of John--how he translated the New Testament, first into the English language, and laid the foundation of an after reformation: are they not found in Trinity College, in the Bodlien, and the King's library, in England?

21 Now this greatest act of John in translating the scriptures, was that which offended Anti-Christ more than any thing else;

22 For by reason of the scripture which the common people had to read, they saw how they had been imposed on by the wicked clergy, who had taken the scriptures from them.

23 Now the reason why they deprived the people of the scriptures was, that they might practice in wickedness, which the scriptures forbid.

24 And by reason of this, the people rejected these spiritual rulers, and their traditions, and submitted to the commands of Christ.

25 Now it came to pass that after John was dead, Christ raised up other witnesses, which gave a greater blow to Anti-Christ than he had ever received before.

CHAPTER V.

1 And it came to pass when Anti-Christ began to be about fifteen hundred years old, that many of Christ's friends publicly opposed him,

2 And said unto him, we will not submit unto thy cruel laws, for they are oppressive and grievous to be borne.

3 And at that time Anti-Christ sent forth one John, whose surname was Tetzel, to sell indulgencies, by which he might raise money to build his palace, which he called the Church of St. Peter.

4 And John said unto the people, I have saved more souls by indulgencies, than ever the Apostle Peter did by preaching the gospel

5 Now it came to pass at that time, that Christ raised up a man called Martin, whose surname was Luther. [Now he was called Martin, because he was born on St. Martin's eve.]

6 And he said unto John, thou hast not power to pardon sins, but thou imposest on the people, that thou mayest increase thy wealth by impoverishing the multitude.

7 Now Martin was mighty in the Scriptures, and had understanding concerning what was contained therein.

8 And as he opposed John, the eyes of the people were opened to see the wickedness of Anti-Christ and the Clergy.

9 And Martin increased in strength, and mightily convinced the people of the wickedness of Anti-Christ and his followers.

10 Now when this came to the ears of Anti-Christ, he was filled with rage againt Martin, & fought to destroy him; for by reason of him many threw off the yoke which Anti-Christ had laid on them.

11 And Anti-Christ wrote unto Martin, whose surname was Luther, saying, thou art an heretic, andunless thou repentest of thy heresy, thou shalt be excommunicated, which will be eternal damnation.

12 Then said Martin, if I have done any thing worthy of death or bonds, I refuse not to die; but unless thou provest from the scriptures that I am an heretic, I shall not acknowledge myself in an error.

13 Then said Anti-Christ unto him, unless thou appear before me, and confess and renounce thy false doctrine, thou shalt be dealt with as an heretic.

14 Now it came to pass that the day before Anti-Christ had decreed to cut him off, that Martin assembled the people of the city, and said unto them, I this day reject Anti-Christ and his doctrine:

15 Moreover I reject the federal plan, adopted by Anti-Christ and his followers, and all the wickedness which they practise, under pretence of being the friends of Christ.

16 Then Anti-Christ was wroth, and sought how he might destroy Martin and his doctrine, which was so injurious to the federal plan.

17 And he wrote unto the Emperor, in whose dominion Martin dwelt, ordering him to deliver up Martin, or he should be exposed to the wrath of Anti-Christ.

18 Howbeit the Emperor obeyed him not, but revolted and threw off the yoke which Anti-Christ had put on his neck, which made ANti-Christ tremble like Magermisabib.

19 Now it came to pass that when Martin found that the Emperor and multitudes of the people had embraced his doctrine, and were opposed to Anti-Christ, that he was much more bold to preach the doctrine of Christ, and to oppose Anti-Christ.

20 And he told the people that though Anti-Christ pretended to be a friend to Christ, yet he was an enemy to him, and to all righteousness.

21 Now these are some of the reasons which Martin brought to prove the wickedness of Anti-Christ, and all the federal band.

22 Martin testified that Anti-Christ and the federal company, called the Clergy, declared that they were not bound to keep the commandments of God. [Now the clergy were considered as Anti-Christ's standing army.]

23 He proved likewise that Anti-Christ said, that there were none who could judge him, but that he is the judge of all men, and that he giveth all laws their force, and yet is not bound to be subject to them.

24 Martin also proved, that Anti-Christ said he had all power to make laws and ordinances for Christ's church, and that Christ had given him power over the heavenly and earthly kingdoms.

25 Anti-Christ also said that his laws were of equal force with the laws of Christ.

26 Martin said likewise that Anti-Christ declared that he only had power to explain the scriptures of truth, and that it was sinful for any man to explain them contrary from what Anti-Christ said was right.

27 Now when this was published abroad, Anti-Christ and his standing army (the clergy) were filled with rage, because Martin had revealed their federal plan, and they sought how they might destroy Martin whose surname was Luther.

CHAPTER VI.

1 And it came to pass after those things, that Christ raised up other adversaries against Anti-Christ,

2 Who mightily convinced the people of the wickedness of Anti-Christ and the clergy, and great multitudes believed their doctrine.

3 Now it came to pass that the people in England began to be weary of the yoke which Anti-Christ had laid on them, and they rebelled.

4 And when this was done, there was immediately heard the confused noise of the warrior, and garments rolled in blood.

5 And after the people had refused to submit to the chief ruler in ANti-Christ's kingdom, who resided at Rome,

6 The whole federal company came together, and Anti-Christ said unto them, let us continue our kingdom in England in disguise;

7 For feeing the people refuse to own our power at Rome, let us form another kingdom upon our plan, and this will serve to extend our dominion.

8 He did also unto them, the reason why they have revolted, is not because they hate our government, but because they wish to have the same power which we claim.

9 For if they can obtain the same power which we possess, they will persecute the disciples of Christ in the same manner we do.

10 Let us therefore advise the clergy in England to build their church upon our federal plan, and let the King be head of their church, as the Pope is the head of ours.

11 Moreover, let us advise them to place their Bishops next to the King in power, as the Cardinals are next in power to the Pope.

12 And as our Bishop (or head) is elected by the Cardinals, so let the Bishops be empowered to crown the King--and that the clergy in England may not be suspected as our friends, let us advise them (instead of wearing scarlet clothes and a red cap) to dress in BLACK UNIFORM, and to wear THREE CORNERED HATS.

13 Let us also advise them to have their parliament composed of Lord's Spiritual and Lord's Temporal, that the government may be in the hands of the Archbishops and Lord Archbishops.

14 Now when Anti-Christ had made mention of these things, the federal company with great reluctance consented that it should be as he said.

15 And after this, Anti-Christ laid the plan before the King and clergy of England, who readily adopted it, and formed their government accordingly.

16 For the King was declared the head of the church, which made the difference between the church of Rome and England to be this, the Pope was the head of one, and the King the head of the other.

17 Now it came to pass that when this was done, the people were filled with great joy throughout all the island of Great-Britain.

18 For the people, and particularly the disciples of Christ, thought they were delivered from the power of Anti-Christ and his wicked clergy.

19 Moreover, many of them believed the time had come which was mentioned in the prophets, when Kigs should be nursing fathers, and Queens nursing mothers.

20 (Now this is the way they nursed the disciples of Christ, the court of inquisition was the nursery; the torturing cords were the swadling bands; the hot lead, which they poured down their throats, was the pap; the grid-iren was the cradle; and the chief ruler under the king, was the hot nurse junior, under the Kings and Queens.)

21 But it was not long before they found that though they were delivered from the power of the Bishop of Rome, yet they were still under the reign of that cruel
monster, Anti-Christ.

22 For experience taught them that the King of England, the Archbishops and clergy of the kingdom, had only deprived the Pope of his power over the people, to possess it themselves.

23 And they also found, that if they ventured to differ in thought word or deed, from the King and clergy, they were exposed to punishment as heretics.

24 Now it came to pass, that when the disciples of Christ found that the change of power had not weakened the power of Anti-Christ, they were filled with sorrow:

25 And they said one to another, we are brought into great straits, for the people think they are Protestants, and that the King and clergy are friends to Christ, and enemies to Anti-Christ.

26 And now if we oppose them, we shall be considered enemies to Christ, because the people believe that the King and clergy are enemies to Anti-Christ.

27 And they said one to another, let us take the laws of Christ for our rule, and put our whole trust in him for support, and venture our lives in his cause.

CHAPTER VII.

1 And it came to pass in those days that there arose a great persecution against the disciples of Christ, because they refused to conform to the laws of Anti-Christ, which were published by the king and clergy.

2 And the clergy said unto them, we are Protestants, for we protest against the power of the Bishop of Rome, and we are friends of Christ, and are bound to punish heretics with death, according to the law of Moses.

3 Then said the disciples of Christ, though you protest against the Bishop of Rome, yet you possess the same spirit he does, and ye are friends of Anti-Christ, even as they also are.

4 Now it came to pass that when they had heard this, they began to call them by odious names, such as anabaptists, schismatics and heretics, who corrupted the holy Catholic church.

4 Now when this came to the ears of Anti-Christ, he sent to the king and clergy in England, to apprehend and punish with burning all who would not abjure their errors.

6 And that all the books written by the disciples of Christ, shall be burnt, and particularly those which speak against the clergy, and the baptizing of infants.

7 Now when these orders came from Anti-Christ, the king and clergy apprehended the disciples of Christ, and ordered them to confess that they were heretics, which
some did through fear.

8 And when they had done this, they were ordered to wear a bunch of faggots tied to their backs when they went to St. Paul's church, (now this was done to shew they deserved death, though their lives were spared through the mercy of the clergy.)

9 But those who would not submit to the laws of Anti-Christ, were publicly burnt at Smithfield, as heretics who ought to die.

10 And though some were burnt alive, and others banished, yet they increased the more, and their doctrine prevailed in all the regions round about;

11 So that the clergy feared lest Anti-Christ would loose his dominion in England, and they be deprived of their places of honor, power and maintenance, which they had from the king's palace.

12 Now these are some of the heresies charged against the disciples of Christ, which was the cause of their being burnt alive by order of the anti-christian clergy.

13 The disciples of Christ taught that the baptism of infants was an invention of Anti-Christ, and one of the main pillars in his kingdom, and that a Priest's sprinkling water on them was blasphemy.

14 They also maintained, that the king and clergy had no right to make laws concerning religion, and that they had a right to choose and support their own ministers.

15 And that those whom Christ commissioned to preach, might not in be hindered by the king and clergy, but that they have a right to go over parish lines, and preach the gospel to every creature.

16 They likewise taught, that to impose on people certain forms of prayer, was contrary to the laws of Christ, and that the manner of worshipping in the church of England was a proof of their subjection to Anti-Christ.

17 Moreover they declared it blasphemy for any man to arrogate to himself the titles of Doctor of Divinity, which is to be called Rabbi, or master of other men's faith.

18 Now it came to pass when these things were noised abroad, the king and clergy (being stirred up by Anti-Christ,) ordered the disciples to be banished, whipped,
burnt, imprisoned, and treated with every kind cruelty.

19 And many of them fled into Germany, and others for some time concealed themselves, while many boldly propagated the doctrine of Christ, notwithstanding all the cruelties of the wicked clergy, who stirred up the people against them.

20 And it came to pass in the sixteen hundred and fourteenth year of Anti-Christ when James was king of England, that one of the disciples of Christ was brought
before the king and clergy, for heresy.

21 And he was there convicted of three things which was termed heresy, for which he was condemned to die, (now the man's name was William, whole furname was Sawtre.)

22 Now these are the heresies he held, that the baptizing of infants was an abominable practice, that the Lord's supper and baptism, ought not to be administered as they are in the church of England.

23 And that the doctrine of Christ is not preached in England by the clergy, as Christ commanded his disciples to preach it.

24 For these things he was burnt alive, to the great joy of the clergy, who were leagued together against all who opposed their wickedness.

25 Now when this was done, the people in England said one to another, if we are Protestants as we profess to be, why protest we against the church of Rome, and
do the same things which they do?

26 And this caused such discontent in the kingdom, that the king and clergy determined not to burn the heretics, but to seize their states and confine them in filthy prisons, to die there; lest they should be considered persecutors, who honored the disciples of Christ with martyrdom.

CHAPTER VIII.

1 And it came to pass, that by reason of the grievous persecutions which the disciples of Christ received from the clergy, that many of them left their native country to find a peaceful retreat from the cruelty of their persecutors.

2 And hearing of a new country called New-England, which was separated from them by a wide ocean, called the Atlantic Ocean, they resolved to take up their abode there, where they might obey their king, Jesus Christ, undisturbed.

3 Now those who sailed for this new world were of different denominations, yet they were called by one common name, which was Puritans.

4 And being agreed, they sailed from England in the sixteen hundred and twentieth year of Anti-Christ, in the eighth month, and the fifth day of the month.

5 Now when this was done, Anti-Christ stirred up the clergy, to prevent their removing across the ocean, fearing that they might become a nursery for the enemies of Anti-Christ and his clergy.

6 However by promising faithfulness to the king, and that they would seek the interest of the gospel, part of them obtained liberty, and part were detained as sureties for the rest.

7 And after sailing many days, they discovered a place called Cape Cod, where they arrived in the eleventh month of the same year, which caused all their hearts to rejoice.

8 And it came to pass after certain days, they landed in a place which they called Plymouth, which name it was retained to this day.

9 Now when they had landed at Plymouth, they said one to another, we are now out of the kingdom of Anti-Christ, for our persecutors remain on the other side of the flood.

10 Let us now adopt a plan of civil and religious government, by which we may live without persecution, and that the generations to come may never be persecuted so long as they maintain the form of government which we have adopted.

11 And they agreed on this plan, that no man should be a magistrate unless he was a member of the church; because that no man was thought fit for a magistrate or church member, unless he was a good man.

12 Now when this was done, many thought they should be happy, and free from persecution, heresies, and divisions.

13 But some of the disciples of Christ said the plan of government laid a foundation for Anti-Christ to introduce his government among them, by which some of them might become persecutors, if any differed from the church and court in doctrine or practice.

14 Now the reason they gave was this--that when Anti-Christ begun his kingdom in Rome, it was by blending the church with the power of the magistrates, by which the bishop become a temporal and spiritual tyrant.

15 Moreover when the king and bishops of our cruel mother Britain protested against the bishop of Rome, and set up a separate government, it was upon the same plan.

16 And by sad experience we have found that the kingdom of Anti-Christ extended in our country, and that we suffered the same from the king and clergy of England, that our fathers suffered from the power of Rome.

17 And now, said they, if this form of government is adopted, it will not be many years before this wilderness will be a place of persecution, where Anti-Christ will reign in disguise.

18 (Now the disciples who opposed this form of government, were called Anabaptists, who denied the power of magistrates in matters of religion, believing that Christ was able to manage his own kingdom without human aid.)

19 Now it came to apss after these things, that the form of government in which the church and colony were connected, was adopted, and for a season the people lived in peace.

20 For the ministers considered themselves servants, and stiled themselves Elders and Pastors of the Churches.

21 And when the news of their peace and prosperity came to the ears of the people in England, many of the disciples of Christ resorted to the new world, to escape the rage of Anti-Christ.

22 Howbeit Anti-Christ was aware of it, and sent over his servants, and they stirred up the government against the disciples of Christ, and the government caused them to be cruelly persecuted.

23 Now the manner of Anti-Christ's introducing his doctrine into New-England, was by stirring up the government against the disciples of Christ, because they refused to obey magistrates in those things which were contrary to the laws of Christ.

24 And after many years, those ministers and people, who first came over to New-England, died: (Now many of them were faithful servants of Jesus Christ, and hearty opposers of Anti-Christ.)

25 And after them rose up men friendly to Anti-Christ, and having the same power which those had, who had gone before them, and not possessing the same temper, they exercised it in promoting the kingdom of Anti-Christ, and persecuting the disciples of Christ.

26 And instead of bearing the name of Elders, they, under Anti-Christ, took the same name which the servants of Anti-Christ were called by in Italy, France, and England, which is the Clergy, and they call themselves by that name unto this day.

CHAPTER IX.

1 And it came to pass in the year of Anti-Christ one thousand, six hundred and forty, that the clergy said, go to, let us build a TOWER in Cambridge, by which our power may be preserved to our sons, and to our sons' sons, to the latest generations.

2 And as the power of the government is in our hands, let us command them to make laws, that no man shall pretend to preach, unless he has gone through the TOWER, which we shall erect for the "honor of our majesties."

3 For by this means we shall prevent the ignorant Anabaptists from setting up to be teachers contrary to our interest, and by which each of us in our parishes may reign unisturbed by such men as are breaking up our churches.

4 Now when this TOWER was built they pretended that it was like the school of the prophets where pious young men were trained up for gospel ministers, though in general they gave but a small evidence of their piety.

5 For any young man, who could "consecrate himself with a bullock and a ram," become a clergyman--and by reason of this, the lowest of the people became clergymen.

6 And after this building was erected, the clergy, who ruled, began to "seek honor one of another," and they heaped on each other the names of Anti-Christ in great abundance.

7 For they called themselves A.B.-A.M.-B.D.-D.D.-S.T.D. and sometimes those who were famous in their cause, had large honors conferred on them, such as A.A.S.-S.H.S.

8 Now these things gave the disciples of Christ reason to think that the clergy were a set of proud, worldly men, who were destitute of righteousness, faith, and the love of God.

9 And seeing how the clergy and their churches "rejected the commandments of God, to keep their own tradition," they resolved to forma church upon the New-Testament plan, which was, that none should be members, unless they were born again.

10 They likewise agreed to reject the baptism of infants, because it was not mentioned in the scriptures, and to baptize w
