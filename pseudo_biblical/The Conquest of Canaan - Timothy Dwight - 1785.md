To his EXCELLENCY, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON, Esquire, 

Commander in chief of the American Armies,

The Saviour of his Country,

And the Benefactor of Mankind;

This Poem is inscribed, with the highest respect for his character, the most ardent wishes for his happiness, and the most grateful sense of the blessings, secured, by his generous efforts, to the United States of North America,

by his most humble,

and most obedient servant,

Timothy Dwight. 

Greenfield, in Connecticut, 
March 1, 1785.

AS this poem is the first of the kind, which has been published in this country, the writer begs leave to introduce it with several observations, which that circumstance alone may perhaps render necessary. 

He has taken to himself the liberty of altering the real order of the two last battles, because he imagined the illustrious events, which attended the battle of Gibeon, would make it appear to be the catastrophe of the poem, whereever inserted. 

He has varied the story of the embassy from Gibeon, for reasons, which he thinks will be obvious to every reader, and which he hopes will be esteemed his sufficient justification. 

To give entire Unity to the Action, he has made Jabia 
the Canaanitish hero through the whole poem ; and has 
transferred the scene of the battle, between Hazor and 
Israel, from the shores of the lake Merom to the neighbourhood of Ai. 

In the Manners, he has studied a medium between absolute barbarism and modern refinement. In the best characters, he has endeavoured to represent such manners, as are removed from the peculiarities of any age, or country, and might belong to the amiable and virtuous, of every age : such as are elevated without design, refined without ceremony, elegant without fashion, and agreeable, because they are ornamented with sincerity, dignity, and religion, not because they are polished by art and education. Of such manners, he hopes he may observe, without impropriety, that they possess the highest advantages for universal application. 

He has made ufe of Rhyme, because he believed h 
would be more generally relifhed than blank verfe, even 
amongfl thofe who are efieemed perfons of tafte. 

It may perhaps be thought the refult of inattention 
or ignorance, that he chofe a fubject, in which his coun- 
trymen had no national interest. But he remarked that 
the Iliad and Eneid were as agreeable to moderp rations, 
as to the Greeks and Romans. The rcafon heluppofed to 
be obvious— the fubjecls of thofe poems furnifh the faireil 
opportunities of exhibiting the agreeable, the novel, the 
anoral, the pathetic, and the fob lime, if he is not deceiv- 






rd, the (dh]et\ lie lias chofen pofTcfles, in a degree, the 
fame advantages. 

It will be obferved that he has introduced fome ne\y 
wo-ds, and annexed to fome old ones, a new f;gnification. 
This liberty, allowed to others, he hones will not be 
rcfufed to him : especially as from this fource the cofpi- 
oufness and refinement of language have been principal- 
ly derived. 

That he wifhes to p^afe he frankly confefies. If he 
fails in the defipn, it will be a fatisfa&ion tliat 
he (hall have injured no perfon but himself. As the 
poem is uniformly friendly to delicacy, and virtue, he 
hopes his countrymen will fo far regard him with candour, 
is not to impute it to him as a fauit, that he has endea- 
voured to pieafe them, and has thrown in his mite, for the 
advancement of the refined arts, on this fide of the 
Atlantic*

And impious nations find avenging feies : 1© 

May thy own deeds exalt the humble lir.e, 
And not a (lain ebfeure the theme divine. 

Whea now from weOern hills the iun was driven, 
And night expanding nil'd the bounds of heaven, 
O'er Israel's camp ten thoufand fires, appear'd ir 

And folemn cries from diftant guards were heard, 
Her tribes, efcap'd from Ai's unhappy plain, 
With ihame and anguifii mourn'd their heroes flain,

From every rival every prize he won.

Aram, his friend, unknowing vile dismay, 
With willing footfieps fhar'd the dangerous way. 
In virtue join'd, one foul to both was given ; 65 

Each fteer'd his path, and led his friend to heaven. 

O'er earth's dim verge as dawn'd the cheerful day, 
Near {lumbering Ai they cours'd their fearless way ; 
Unfeen, in twining fnrubs, a heathen late, 
Mark'd their flill path, and boded Aram's fate ; 70 

Swift hurl'd, his javelin fought the hero's fide, 
Pierc'd to the heart, he groan'd, and gafp'd, and died. 
The heathen flew, fierce Zimri c'ave his breait, 
But Aram's eyes were clos'd in endless rett. 

Thus, 'while fond Virtue wifh'd in vain to fave, 75 

Hale, bright and generous, founff a hapless grave. 
With genius' living flame his beforn glow'd, 
And fcience charm'd him to her fweet abode : 
In worth's fair path his feet adventur'd far; 
The pride of peace, the riling grace of war; 80

Clouded his front, and urg'd the tear to flow. 13s 

Of princely blood, his haughty fire, of ycre 
Proud Pharaoh's favourite on th Egyptian ihore, 
O'er Israel's race was fcepter'd to pref.de, 
To rule their tributes and their toils to guide. 

In the fon's mind again the parent liv'd, 135 

His pride rekindled, and his art reviv'd. 
Where'er pride call'd, his changing foul would turn ;

And cheat the pious with uplifted eyes ; 14$

Or hope to fvvay alone by reafon's voice, 420 

He thus began. Ye heirs of Jacob's name, 
Let JoPnua's voice your generous candor claim.- 
In Israel's facred cause my toils ye know, 
My midnight watchings, and my morning woe. 
Your long, lone path my wakeful eye furvey'd, 425 

Charm'd the fad wild, and cheer'd the languid head ; 
Sooth'd drooping fickness, banim'd fear's alarms 
And clafp'd the orphan with delighted arms ; 
'Gainil fierce invafions rais'd a guardian ihield, 
The firft to feek, the last to leave, the field ; 430 

For all your tribes a parent's fondness prov'd, 
FulfilPd each wiih, and even your wanderings lov'd. 

In thofe fad scenes, when pity owns applaufe, 
Not Hanniel's tears adorn a fairer cause. 
For Israel's woe does Kanniel fmgly (eel ? 43- 

Are~ thefe ey-es blind ? or is this boforn fieel ? 
When ceas'd thefe hands from toil ? or what ftrange fun 
Saw Jofhua's feet the haunts of danger fnun ? 
Your eyes have feen, thefe honeil fears proclaim 
How oft this breait has pour'd the vital ftream: 440

The CONQUEST op CANAAN. 
BOOK II. 



BEYOND thofa western hills, whofe haughty brow, 
To heaven exalted, fcorn'd the world below, 
A plain outfpread, with growing verdure bright, 
And flole, extenfive, from the aching Tight. 
Here, in proud pomp, adorn'd with countless fpires, 5 
That mock'd the glories of the folar fires, 
Gibeon's imperial towers fublimely rofe, 
And fpurn'd the terrors of furrounding foes. 

Now o'er the hills red itreams began to burn, 
And burfting fplendors ufher'd in the morn ; i# 

With living dies the flowers all-beauteous giow'd ; 
O'er the glad fields etherial odours flovv'd ; 
Th: forest echoed with a boundless long, 
Andrismg breezes pour'd the ftrains alonj. 

Adorn'd with gree^n, before the palace lay 1 - 

A fpacious fquare, and fmil'd npon the day. 
Here, ere the dawn the kindling Ikies ilium 'd, 
Or opening Bowers the fragrant gales perfum'd, 
Qfevery age, a valt, aiTembled train 
Pour'd from the lofty domes, and fill'd the plain. 2 # 

High in the midvt two facred altars fhone, 
Adorn'd with honours to their God, the Sun. 
This, deck'd with art, and bright in royal pride, 
With &ble gore the quivering victim died ;

And gales of Eden bore their fweets away. 

Here, white with age, in fnowy vesture dress'd,

And his hx'd countenance watch'd the riling fun. 5c 

When nrft the flaming Orb, with glorious rays, 
RolPd o'er the hills, and pour'd a boundless blaze ; 
Charm'd at the fight, the monarch ftretch'd his hand, 
And touch'd the tributes with the iacred brand ; 
Through frefhen'd air perfumes began to rife, 35 

And curling volumes mounted to the &ies. 
Thrice to the earth the raptur'd fuppliants how'd,

LafaM by the flood, the hard rocks wear away *

Unchang'd alone is thine exalted flame, 

From endless years to endless years the fame ; 60 

Thy fpie-vJors with immortal beauty ibine, 

Rdll round th' eternal heavens, and fpeak thy name divine. 

When thy bright throne, beyond old ocean's bound, . 
Thro* nether fkies purfues its dellin'd round, 
Loft in th' afcending darkness, beauty fades ; 6$. 

Thro' the blank field, an ! thro* the woodland, fpreada 
A melancholy filence. O'er the plain 
Dread lions roam, and favage terrors reign. 

And when fad Autumn fees thy face retire, 
And happier regions hail thy orient fire, 7$ 

High in the ftorm imperious Winter flies, 
And defolation faddens all the&ies. 
But when once more thy beam the north afcer.ds, 
Thy light invigerates, and thy warmth extends ; 
The fields rejoice, the groves with tranfport ring, 75 
And boundless nature hails the iky -born fprir.g. 

Nor even in winter's gloom, or night's fad reign, 
Darts the warm influence of thy beams in vain. 

Beyond the main fome fairer region lies, 
Some brighter if es beneath the fouthern Ones, tm 

Where crimfon War ne'er bzde the clarion rear, 
Nor fanguir.e billows died the vernal more : 
No thundering ftorm the day's bright face conceals, 
No fummer fcorches, and no fro ft congeals ; 
No ficknefi waftas, no grief provokes the tear, S5 

Nor tainted vapours bl-ait the clement year. 
Round the glad day-ftar endless beauties burn, 
And crown'd with rainbows, opes th' imperial morn ; 
A clear unbounded light the f&cs difplay, 
And purple luftre leads the changing day. g&

Returned the lovely maid, Thy glad request 
Wakes my fond hope, and warms my grateful breaft — 
Know, mighty prince, when Elam's deathful fpear 275 
Pierc'd the fell foe, and loos'd my foul from fear, 
From I{ra*l' scamp, thro' unknown paths, I ftray'd, 
My lone fteps wandering round the woodland ihade. 
Twas there, the facred truths the prophet fung, 
And thus fa-eet mufic tun'd his heavenly tongue. 28© 

From realm* divine high-rais'd beyond all height, 
Th' almighty Parent caft his piercing fight ; 
"With boundless view, he faw the etherial vaft 
A clouded gloom, an undelightfome wafte : 
-Around the extended wild, no fun's broad ray 285 

Mark'd the clear fplendor of immortal day ; 
No varying moon, ordain'd at eve to rife, 
Led the full pomp of conftellated fides ; 
No day in circling beauty learn'd to roll ; 
No fair fpring fmil'd, nor froft congeal'd the pole ; 29* 
Subftamial darkness fpace unmeafur'd fill'd, 
And nature's realms lay defolate and wild.

The heavens wide-arching ftretch'd their fapphire round* 
With hoary cliffs the far-feen hills afcend ; 295 

Down fink the vales, and wide the plains extend ; 
Headlong from iieep to fteep the billows roar, 
Fill the broad main, and tofs again ft the fhore.

With fpringing verdure earth's wide regions glow'd ;;p#

Swarm'd in the ftreams, and fwam the Ocean's bounds 
The green fea fparkied with unnumber'd dies, 31I 

And varying beauty wav'd upon the flues ; 
Whales through the foaming billows proudly rode, 
And unknown mongers gambol 'd o'er the flood. 
From the deep wave, adorn'd with nobler grace, 315

Thro' the far clouds the eagle clest his way, 
And foar'd and wanton'd in the flames of day ;

In throngs, unnumber'd rofe the beilial trains :

The lion glar'd, and mid the gazing throng %2% 

Shook his rough main, and grimly ftalk'd along.

A lovelier image, and a fofter mind. 
To her he gave to kindle fweet denre, 
To roufe great thoughts, and fan th' heroic fire : 
At pity's gentle call to bend his ear ; 355 

To prompt for woe the unaffected tear ; 
In scenes refin'd his foftening foul improve, 
And tune his wifnes with the hand of love. 
To her he gave with fweetness to obey, 
Infpire the friend, and charm the lord away ; 36* 

Each bleeding grief with balmy hand tohsal, 
And learn his rending fmews not to feel ; 
Each joy t' improve, the pious wiih to raife, 
And add new raptures to his languid praife.

(An hundred fummers faw the circling morn, 

Ere his firfthope, the promised heir was born) 

To him, to his he gave Canaan's more, 

'Till the bright evening gild the well no more. 530 

To Idol guilt the world befide was given, 

Their name, their memory blotted out of heaven. 

When the dire famine o'er all nations fpread, 
His hand the favorite race to Egypt led. 
As fome fair tree, where fruitful ilreams are roll'd, 535 
Lifts fpiry moots, and bids its leaves unfold ; 
O'er the green bank ambitious branches rife, 
Enjoy the winds, and gain upon the Ikies ; 
While opening flowers around it gayly fpring,

With bold oppreflion bath'd the ftreaming eye, 
Rack'd the fad foul, and rous'd the fuppliant cry. 

Their bleeding wrongs the omnilcient Mind furvcy'd, 
And bade fierce Vengeance bare her flaming blade. 55*

Three days blank midnight wrapp'd the realm in gloom, 
And all her firft-BoVh funk in one broad tomb. 

Then, high in air his lucid banner fpread, 
To the bright sign collected Israel Med, 
With tranfport trac'd the finger of the fky, 565 

Wing'd their glad path, and haiPd redemption nigh. 
In vain its countlessills the wafte difclos'd ; 
In vain thefea their facred path oopos'd ; 
Back rolPd th' inftincTIve main ; and round their fide 
In cryftal fplendor ftood the conscious tide. 570 

In the bright front, a cloud his dark abode, 
Thron'don the rufhing winds, an angel rode, 
The fpreading volumes mark'd their path by day, 
And guiding flames illum'd their nightly way. 
Behind, the tyrant, urg'd by Heaven's decree, 575 

Drove his pale holt, and trembled thro' the fea. 
On the tall fliore fublime the Prophet ftood, 
And fbetch'd his hand above the eager flood ; 
Wide-circling all, far clos'd thebillow'd womb, 
And Egypt's glories found a watery tomb. 589 

Thro' fpacious climes of fierce and fcorching day, 
The cloud expanded led their lonely way, 
'Till, white with cliffs, and crown'd with many a (hade, 
In cloudy pride fam'd Sinai rear'd its head.

On earth to witness truth and power divine,

And thunders, hurl'd on thunders rock the fcy : 

To Sinai's top the wonderous scene defcends ; 

Down plunge hiscliffi ; his tottering fummit rends ; 6oo> 

O'er all the mountain burn devouring fires, 

Wreith'd in dread fmoke, and crown'd with lofty fpires. 

J .cud as hoarfe whirlwinds earth and heaven deform, 

Loud as the thoufand thunders of the ftorm, 

With clear, dread voice, in pomp tremendous, roll 605 

The trump's long-founding terrors thro* the pole. 

The Seer majestic climbs the towering height, 

And, bofom'd deep in glo»y, leaves the fight. 

There, while the world was hufh'd in filent awe, 
The Sovereign Mind difclos'dth' eternal Law ; 610

From Egypt's bondage trac'd thy various ways;

Thy parent's voice with reverent mind obey :

Let nor 3 thought thy neighbour's couch afcend ; 
.And not a wifti to others wealth extend : 620 

Let truth thy converfe, truth thy oaths confine : 
And every pafiion to thy lot resign.

The poor protected, and the rich restrain*d; 
And taught, what manners profperous rule a flare, 625 
Their foes to vanquifh, and their peace fecure. 

Then thro' long, weary climes their courle was turn'd, 
Still mov'd the cloud, and Mill the glory burn'd.

Thro* long, lone paths we bent our circling courfe,

Bright angels led the van ; and round the road 
Dread scenes of terror mark'd the present God.

With nimble Heps the facred warriors fped, 
Blew the (brill trump, and fill'd the field with dead. 6^a 
Like drifts of rufhing duft, that fweep the ikies, 
On fear's light pinions fwift the remnant Hies ; 
From town to town we wing our rapid way, 
And the wide region finks an eafy prey. 

Then giant Og his heroes drove to arms, 65 £ 

Whirl'd his proud car, and thunder'd hoarle alarms : 
Jn ditlant fields I faw the ftorm afcend, 
Its (hades all darken, and its clouds extend ;

And burfting terrors rend the ihuddering pole. 660 

As i'nows, flight fabric, in warm funs decay,

Oft would each fire his tender witn declare, 
To fee one hand unite the lovely pair. 
Oft fjgh'd the youth t' unfold his anxious mind ; iai

7\rd half-heard wiflves trembled e'er his torque. 
At length, kind Heaven, propitious to the pair, 
Led his fond flsps, where love had led the fair. i tG

Sirpriz'd, his tongue unbidden told his pain.

Smil'd in his hopes, and blels'd with love renn'd,

And from his couch impatient Irad fprings, 
To morn's unnumber'd fweets invites the fair,

Or, fcap'd the held, their wearv feet mult fail ? 
Or, joinM in fight, our arms will foon prevail ; 5S0 

This day beyond purfuit our courfe removes, 
And leaves the tyrant to the Haves he loves. 

He fpoke ; at once, from all th* impatient train, 
A bud of triumph fhook the founding plain ; 
Thence rofe the fhout ; as oft the heavens replied ; 585 
And, borne thro' fields, and wood*, the far-off murmur died. 
Thus, when the vernal florm forbears to rave, 
And the wild river f.vells his torrent wave, 
Huge iiles of ice, along the clifted more. 
Float flow, and cumbrous ; folemn thunders roar, 590 
In deep gradations, rife, and burft, and it! 1 , 
Wave o'er the founding hills, and leilen to the pole. 

When finl from Joihua faithful Irad went,

Bade them the tribes with prudent caution eye, 59;

A flow, and lingering groan afcends the pcie;

But that proud voice, which aw'd my breaft before,

All foes despjs'd, and Joiliua fear'd, no more ; 
From voice to voice the haughty tale rebounds, 695 

And air re-echoes with the mingling founds. 

As near the diflant groves the warriors drew, 
And homeward call a lingering, parting view ; 
Behold ! in eaftem fields a numerous train

As near the noify fquadrons Jofhua drew, 
Round the rude riles he caft a fearching view ; 
For Hanniel's fleps he gaz'd ; but gaz'd in vain, 715 

Nor found the hero on the troubled plain. 
For well his mind, by fad experience, knew 
What fearful ills defeated plots purine. 
How fway accuftom'd, faction wild o'erihrows,

Thence, to his tent by cautious thoughts conhVd,

Too wife the Chief, too fix'd tive hoft, he faw ; 725 

Too firm th' obedience to the facred law ;

In pomp divine the great Archangel flood ; 761

Dire as ten thunders, rufn'd his flaming ftcel ;

Swift as the rapid whirlwind, o'er th' empyreal plain.

Like ocean's waves, the Tons of Ai were driven, 

And lowering Israel cad a glocm on heaven ;

And the great Chief a ftrong injunftion gave,

To tempt no lofs,and hazard no difgrace. 

But far beyond his thoughts, the four.d of war, 825 

The clafn of arms, the (boats that rend the air,

New ibung their nerve?, and rous'd their hopes again. 

Jn quick oblivion, flight and fear were loft;

BOOK IV. 



NOW the third fun illum'd the azure main, 
And Israel anxious gather'd on the plain. 
In every face fufpenfe and grief appear'd, 
Each fon was doubted, and each parent fear'd ; 
Brothers on brothers cad a fide-long eye, $ 

And trembling fair-ones press'd the riling .figh. 

Mid the wide concourfe great Eleazar ihone, 
The facred minifter of Heaven's high throne. 
White were his aged locks> and round his face 
Calm contemplation call a fjlemn grace ; 10 

O'er his pure vesture mining unguent fpread, 
And breath'dthe fragrance ofth' Arabian made ; 
Full on his breaft the ftar-bright Urim glow'd, 
And o'er his brow bcam'd Holiness to God. , 

The facred rites perform'd, he bent his way 15 

To the bright dome that inock'd the riling day. 
The train with reverence bow'd. Around his head 
Red fpires of lambent flame ferenely play'd ; 
On the clear fplendors gaz'd the crowd around, 
And deep attention hufh'd the fhady ground. 20 

Now in the facred place the Priefl ador'd, 
And thus his voice Jehovah's fmiles implor'd. 
O thou, whole wifdombaiit the bright abodes,

Almighty Father hear ! Let grace divine 25 

ohower on our hoft, and cleanfe from every fin ! 

Thoufeest, Omflifcient Mind ! what guilt unknown 

Pollutes our race, and dares infultthy throne: 

'Ihou feest ; and oh may thy all-gracious voice 

That guilt declare, and bid thy fons rejoice ! 30 

He fpoke. A ruining found of winds began, 
Sung in the vail, and thro' the temple ran ; 
A fapphire flame, unutterably bright, 
Shot from the gloom, and wrapp'd the walls in light ; 
The dome all trembled ; earth beneath it fliook ; 3 : 

And o'er the ark a voice in thunder fpoke— 
To Israel's thoufands, from th' Eternal throne, 
This mighty mandate by thy voice be known. 
Of Judah's race, a wretch, by madness driven, 
With impious hand, hath dar'd the wrath of Heaven : 
Stones fhaU his houfe d&ftroy, and flames devour ; 4!

Nor more ; an awful darkness round him fpread, 
Still as the gloomy manfions of the dead. 

All fad, a!i flow, return'd the mournful priefl, 45 

And flrong impatience every eye express'd— 
What the decree of Heaven ! the Leader cried— 
With folemn voice, the facred Seer replied —

His front was clouded with a wild dismay ; 
For haflening ruin darken'd o'er his way. 

And thus the youth forlorn— My hated name 
Sinks in the milery of undying lhame, - 
Pafs'd is the day of grace ; my dimmed light 65 

Fades in the feirt of everlailing night. 
From the rich fpoils my hand a flore convey M, 
Help'd by the night, and fafe in covert laid. 
Beneath my tent the mifctoief may be found, 
Where fpreads the flooring o'er the fecret ground. -1 

Why did my hearjt refill that lovely fair, * 
Who fweetly warn'd me of the tempting fnare ? 
Hear, all ye warriors ! fly the fatal road, 
And learn, that vengeance waits the foes of God ! 

Great Jofhua heard ; and tho' his feeling mind 75 
To crimes was gentle, and to miiery kind ; 
Fierce on the youth he cad a dreadful eye, 
That wither'd ail his ftrength, and bade him die. 
And could no honour, and no law, controul 
The groveling wifhes of thy gloomy foul ? So 

How durft thou, impious, face th' Almighty rod, 
Put forth rebellious hands and ileal from God ? 
Didfl thou not know, weak man ! th* avenging Sky 
Trac'd thy dark footfleps with all-fearching eye r" 
Didft thou not fear, amidft the gloomy deed, 85 

Its vengeance burfting on thy guilty head ? 
Didft thou not fear the flings of confeious fhame ? 
The thunder's terror ; or the lightning's flame ? 
Go, raife to Heaven the fad, repenting eye, 
A Heaven that hears, when Mifery lifts her cry ! 90 

Perhaps foft Mercy yet may lend an ear, 
While thy fun glimmers in his 1 all career. 
Not pity's wiih, but folly's, hides from view 
The wretch, whom Juflice' awful f^et purfue. 
Go then, unpardon'd, fink in (hame forlorn, 5:5 

Of Heaven the victim, and of earth the fcorn ;

To light bewiider'd error back to day.

Walk'd trembling onward to a diftant vale : ioo

And Pity's eye parfued him to the grave.

And kind companion in their bofoms glow'd : 
When rob'd in fair attire, two flrangers came, loj 

And bow'd respe&ful, at the Hero's name. 
One, pafs'd his ftrength, was grae'd with manly fears, 
Crown of the brave, and palm of glorious wars ; 
T2II was his frame, his countenance roughly kind, 
And his calm front with hofteil boldness fhin'd. 1 ie 

3>ess'd in light robes, as flowers adorn the wild, 
In nature's prime his young companion lrnil'd 
Sweetness inessable.. Devoid of art, 
His eye, ibft-glowing, look'd the friendly heart. 

Hail Grangers, haii ! the mighty Hero cried, 1 15 

Whofc port bespeaks a nation's fetrest pride. 
Bring your kind hands the peaceful branch from far ? 

Or pant your bofoms for the fate of war ? 

The elder chief replied—From Gibeon's king 

Our friendly hands no hoiiile meflage bring. 12« 

Tho' once in fight renowned* now filver age 

Serenes his brow, and cools ambition's rage. 

'Tis his firft qlory, Gibeon's weal t' encreafe, 

To foothe fad woe, and widen human bliis. 

Pafs'd are five morns, fince round th' extended plain, 

With .'on ] impatience, rufh'd a chofen train, 126 

O'er rocks, and Itreams, the nimble deer purfued, 

Trac'd the wild marfn, and fcour'd theJevimis wood.

*Twixt two rough favages, whofe hungry eyes 

.Lower'd death, and ruin, o'er their helpieis prize, 

Fair as the ftar of morn, a lovely maid, 1 35 

In pangs of terror, call'd in vain for aid. 

Her robes embroider'd loofely met the view ; 

Her hair, unbound, in wild dilbrder flew ; 

All pile (he flood, and to the pitying flcy 

Stretch'd her white hands, and rais'd a piercing cry. 140 

la vain, on terror's wings, the caitiffs Hew ; 

His eager fword this generous hero drew ; 

Their heads in twain the fteely vengeance clave, 

And hungry vultures yield the horrid grave. 

To Gibeon's domes we led the beauteous fair, 145 

Repos'd on down, and nurs'd with tendered care. 
Pleas'd with our pains, her fweet, angelic tongue 
Strange truths divine, with heavenly mufic, fang* 
Of nature's Sovereign Lord, the tale began, 
How earth was form'd, and how created man ; 1 50 

How the tall mountains heav'd their cloud-wrapp'd fpires* 
And heaven was ftarr'd with thoufand thoufand met. 
Then too me told how, rous'd to fearful ire, 
]t.hovah bade the delug'd world expire ; 
Thy nation's rife; the rod of Sovereign power, ' 155 
That ihook proud Egypt's realms from more to fnore, 
The cleaving main ; the wonders of the wild, 
Where hard rocks flow'd, and fands with verdure fmil'd ; 
Food, fhower'd from heaven, perfum'd the morning blast, 
And quails in millions peopled all the wafte. 160 

In thefe dread scenes, Aradon's mighty mind 
The clear difplays of boundless powtr divin'd ; 
Scenes nobler far than ancient fages knew, 
Than age e'er taught, or airy fancy drew. 
At once, infpir'd with eager zeal to learn j£- 

What wondrous truths the glorious fcheme concern, 
This prince, his only hope, the monarch chofe, 
And joia'd with me, his pleaiuie to diillde.

AH paths with him were fmooth, that Ihew'd a name,20t; 
Tho' flaughter'd nations pav'd the road to fame. 
Thrice rofe the chief to thwart the Leader's choice, 
And thrice ftrange faltering feiz'd his opening voles ; 
Far round he carts his keen, experiene'd view, 
And peace, the wifh of every bofom, knew ; 1 : p 

With fhame his dauntless front was cover'd o'er, 
And the cheek blufh'd, that never blufh'd before. 

Pleas'd the great Leader faw his failing eye, 
And voice, in vain, attempt a bafe reply, 
Then fmiling thus— -Uutaught the wiles of ait 215

To footh vain pride with conqueiVs dreadful name ; 
To pamper avarice with the fpoils of fhame ; 
To take one hour from man's too hafty doom, 225 

Or force one widow to a huiband's tomb. 
From death's fad fcenc;, and battle's horrid toils,

When fwords alone can plead the righteous cause, 
The crimfon ffeel his hand reluctant draws ; 23a 

Grief walks his partner to the dreadful plain, 
And gloiv's maniions prove the haunts of pain. 

'Tis Jfra . i weal t' increafe ; 

To ftretch the reign, and nurfe the arts, of peace ;

To teach vain man the biifs to virtue given, 
And with new faints r enlarge the bounds of heaven.

$i BOOK IV. 

Her fire, in Edom's realm, our nation join'd, 

Urg'd by the dictates of a virtuous mind : 

Her, a fweet babe, his hand indulgent b-re, 

To virtue form'd, and nurs'd in facred lore. 

As fome bright HlJy, daughter of the morn, 2.t; 

Swells its young leaves, and bids its fplendors burn ; 

Fair, and more fair, th' expanding beauties glow, 

Dance in the fun, and fhame the driving fnow ; 

So, born for heaven, ftiil brightening to the view, 

From truth to truth, from charm to charm, fhe grew; 25* 

Soft was her temper ; all her thoughts refin'd ; 

Beauty her form, and virtue was her mind. 
Now at the tent arriv'd, the fair they found ; 

"With many a lovely maid incompafs'd round ; 

"With fmiles of joy, their friend the virgins hail'd, 2^5 

And gentle tears on every cheek prevail'd. 

When firit her Sire appear'd, around his form 

She cart, with fweetest grace, each fnowy arm ; 
Pleas'd the great Hero eyed his lovely child, 
And gave the fond embrace, and o ? er the charmer fmil'd., 
Sweet maid! he cried, where rov'dll thou from the plain? 
With tears we fought thee, but we fought in vain. 262 

Far in the wood, replied the fair, I ltray'd, 
"No care dilturb'd me, and no fear dismriy'd : 
Charm'd with the flowers, that, undiftinguiiVd, fmil*d 
With foiitary beauty round the wild. 266 

A plum'd mufician, on her verdant throne, 
Hymn'd, with fof: tranfport, to the falling fun.

So long I wander'd, day forfook the fky ;

The wolf began to howl ; and all around, 275 

The hungry panther {hook the (huddering ground ; 
Loud roar'd the approaching lion's dread alarms, 
And death rufh'd by me, in a thojfand forms. 

The long, long, dismal night at length was gone ; 
And cheerful day with pleafmg beauty (hone. 2S0 

Kufh'd was the world, fave where, along the wood, 
Rung the foft current of a Giver flood. 
Down verdant banks, with trembling fteps I ftray'd ; 
Each breeze alarm'd me, and each leaf dismay'd ; 
Till, near the confines of the lonely ftrearn, 285 

R> fe two barbarians, as the tyger grim. 
My hated ga^b difpieas'd their lavage eves, 
And female weakness bade their lufl arife. 
O why was ftrength to mifcreant villains given ? 
Why lovely virtue lest unarm'd by heaven ? 290 

Why muft the helpless fair-one's glory Hand 
A prey, for every monger's brutal hand ? 
Thus mourn'd my heart ; when Elam rufh'd to fight, 
Clave the dire foes, and calm'd my wild affright ; 
At once low-whiiper'd Virtue's heavenly friend—- 295 
Weak are the fair, that heroes may defend. 

She fpoke. The blufh that gives the brightefl charm, 
Glow'd in her face, and told her heart's alarm. 
Skill'd in the fcience of the human foul, 
Th' experiene'd Chief beheld her pafiions roll, 300 

Smii'd at th* exprefuve language of her eye, 
The dancing bofom, and the deep drawn figh. 

On Elam's face he turn'd a fearching view, 
Trac'd his young flame, and all his wiihes knew. 
Oft on the virgin glanc'd his eamest gaze ; 305 

She glance for glance, and blufh for blufh, repays ; 
Their eyes prove faithful to the melting heart, 
Waft the fond wifh, and all the foul impart.

No pride of beauty wak'd his young defires ; 31® 

Nor eye that fparkles, fraught with lambent fire? ; 
Nor chee!:, that gaily fhines with morning glow ; 
Nor downy bofom, dipp'd in fpotless fncw. 
He figh'd for charms of nature more refin'd, 
The Maker's image, in the fair one's mind ; 
Such charms, as found in heaven, delight improve, 315 
And plac'd in angels prompt an angel's love. 

Thus while they psus'd ; with fvveet, and modest grace. 
Fear in his eye, and blufhes o'er his face, 
The trembling youth began---0 Chief divine ! 
My parent's voice thou hcard'il, difdain not mine. 320 
To this bright maid my vvifhes would aipire— 
O blame not ! frown net on the fpotless (ire !--- 
Thou know'ft the joy her virtues yield to thee ; 
Then think her hand were paradife to me. 

Pleas'd the Chief faw his eyes with fondness (bine, 325 
And mien all modest, -merit's faithful iign, 
And thus— O fair 1 'tis thine alone to choofe. 
Say, muil this heart fo foon its darling lofe ?

And gild alike the darkness and the day. 

And thou, brave Elam ! dill, as morn returns, 

While early tranfport in thy bofom burns, 

On firm foundations let thy fondness rest, 

Nor cold indifference canker in thy breaft. 350

Though oft on earth forgot, arefeai'd in heaven : 

Then let thy fond connubial aciions mew 

Truth was the language of the lover's vow. 

And thou, my child, to Heaven thyfeif approve ; 355

So fhall your lives fereneiy dance away, 

And blifs unclouded light the fetting day. 

But now, brave friends, let p.ieafure round us roll ; 

Enjoy the genial feafl, and mare the bowl ; 263 

Three days, with me, and every pleafure, ftav ; 

The fourth glad morn mail gild your homeward way.'

With manly dignity the chiess confess'd.

Th' attendant train the cheerful feaft prepare ; 
With kindly warmth the fmoaking cauldrons glow, 
And fvveet thro' ether rilir.g odours rlow. 

So vaft, fo various, was the Leader's mind, 
It rov'd through every region, unconiin'd ; -»$ 

From scenes fublime, with foft tranfition, ran 
Thro' all the duties, all the weal, of man ; 
At once his friends, his race, his Maker, {erv y d; 
At once his own domeiiic blifs preferv'd ; 
In nice dependence rang'd the fervant train, -•,- 

And o'er his houfe bade beauteous order reign. 
Thro' all their minds Religion's influence ran— 
Men, true to Heaven, he knew were true to man—

Hence, rich return o r ali his watchful toil, 
No murmur pain'd him, and no houmold broil. 
Peace round his manfion fhed her influence mild, 
And cheerful, friendly, each domestic fmil'd. 

Now the lov'd maid had 'fcap'd from r a\age bands, 385 
With twofold pleafure, wrought their adive hands. 
Sojuft, fo gentle was her angel mind, 
To want fo bounteous, and to all fo Wind, 
Her, as tne Leader, each alert obey'd, 
And thought it biifs to pleafe the heavenly maid, 5"^ 

Mean time, felecled for the genial fealt, 
To Jofhua's ter.tcame many a princely guest ; 
Their courteous hearts the nobie Grangers greet, 
And hail the fair with gratulation fweet. 

O'er a valt board a wide pavilion fpread, 395 

\Yi:h grandeur min'd, and call a pleafing made. 
There fate the guests ; there cates delight the ioul ;

In calm oblivion roll their cares away. 40^

While hoary Hezron watch'd with boding eyes, 
And faw, well-pleas'd, the future hero rife. 

There too, in tranfport brighten'd Caleb's pride, 
With tears, embracing Elam's lovely bride ; 4 20 

Yet felt foft pain, to fee her favourite's charms, 
The deilin'd treafure of a Granger's arms, 
To fee her days at diftance doom'd to roll, 
And mingling friendship foothe no more the foul. 

In eafy converfe pafs'd the hours away ; 42$ 

Each face fhone cheerful, and each heart was gay ; 
In glad fucceifion went the goblets round, 
And blended voices gave a jocund found. 

Mean time throng'd numerous round the Leader's door, 
The ftranger, orphan, widow, and the poor ; 430 

Call'd from each tribe, by Jofhua's kind command, 
A rare-felt joy infpir'd the friendless band ; 
They feafted, fang, and in the dance combin'd, 
Pour'd forth the raptures of th' oblivious mind: 
Then, moving various, o'er the camp they fpread, 435 
Each blifs imploring on the Leader's head. 

When now the feaft was o'er, the fun drew nigh 
The gilded borders of the western fey : 
Forth to the temple march'd th' illuftrious train, 
The thoufands gathering o'er th' extended plain. 440 
From a tall rock, amid the filent crowd, 
The fuppliant Hero rais'd his voice aloud— 

O thou, whofe hand illum'd yon rolling fire, 
Stretch'd the wide plains, and bade the hills afpire, 
Rul'd by whofe power, the liars unnuraber'd rife, 44.5 

And fwift-wing'd lightnings flame athwart the fkies, 
Storms ride majestico'er th' etherial plain, 
And wake the fleeping thunders of the main ! 
Empires, at thy command, arife, and fall ; 
And flight and triumph haften at thy call ! 450 

Difclofe, O Power Divine 1 thy fovereign voice- 
Docs combat pleafe thee ? combat is our choice— 
O

Does peace delight thee ? peace alone we prize, 

Led by thy will, and guided by thine eyes. 

By thee this land to Abraham's race was given, 455 

'Till funs withdraw, and ftars are loft in heaven: 

Jf now the bright poffefiion Cod ordain, 

And crowns await us, on the erimfon plain, 

By fome great sign th' eternal fmiles difplay, 

And point our footfieps to the fierce affray t 46* 

At once a hollow wind began to roll, 
As diftant thunders rumble round the pole ; 
The fields grew black, the forests felt th' alarm, 
And fwifc through ether ruftTd a cloudy ftorm, 
High heaven all trembled with the dreadful found, 4^5 
And peals on peals, convuluve, (hook the ground. 
Far round the facred dome the darkness fpread ; 
The fun's clear fplendor vanifn'd in the fhade : 
Red flames burft forth ; the confeious mountains nod, 
And the world fmckes beneath th' approaching God. 

Jn filentawe, the camp afionim'd flood ; 47 1 

And each burn'd fiercely for the day of blood. 
Fix'd in Mill wonder, gaz'd the ftranger pair, 
Andmark'd, with anxious mind, the darkening air, 
The dome, invelop'd in the fable fhroud, 475 

And peals deep-murmuring in the hollow cloud : 
With folemn look, each freqnent eyed his friend, 
And felt, inftinclive, half-form'd prayers afcend. 

Mean time the Leader every chief commands- 
Two dsys, let peace refreln the fainting bands; 4S 
The third glad fun, awak'd by trumpet's found, 
Shall light our falchions to the deathful ground. 
Sleep, hap!; is Ai ! thy lall returning day 
Soon gilda rhv turrets with a pitying ray. 
And let the chief, th' important charge who owns, 485 
Of all our wealth, our Hives, an-d blooming fons, 
Bid a Idng trench wind through the tented ground, 
And guardian walls the fpacious camp furrou-ad. 



B O O K IV 99 

He fpoke. With joy th' attendant chiess obey'd, 
.And round the camp the glad commands convey'd. 490 
The fqaadrons ardent wait th' appointed morn, 
Cleanfe their blue fliields, and poliuYd coats adorn. 
So Jofhua will'd ; for well the Hero knew 
How glittering fteel allur'd the raviih'd view ; 
Thence prais'd the chief, in mining neatness arm'd, 405 
Averfe from toys, but with true beauty charm'd ; 
And thence in glorious panoply he blaz'd, 
A great example, acting all he prais'd. 

Now round the world pale Eve her fadness threw; 
Still, folemn darkness cloudy curtains drew ; C.CX? 

Through the wide camp the Leader trac'd his way, 
To lea-m what wifnes markM the bufy day. 
Ai, full in view, each heart to combat nYd, 
And with gay profpects every breaft infpir'd. 
No thought of Egypt boding minds embrac'd ; 505 

No childifh fear even vulgar fouls difgrac'd : 
In deeo oblivion funk the painful wound, 
And fierce impatience hop'd th" embattled ground. 
Pleas'd the great Hero heard th* exulting ftrain, 
And wandering, Iiftening, fought his tent again. 51© 

When now the morn look'd mildly from the eaft, 
To Jofhua Elam thus his voice address'd--- 
O Chief of Israel, crown'd with grace divine ! 
Let health's green garland round thy temples twine. 
To bless mankind be ftill thy lov'd employ ; 51 £ 

To ferve thv Maker ftill thy facred joy ; 
No hour of thine to wafting grief be given ; 
Let each m ore brightly roll, and antedate thy heaven -1 
But now, his years impatientofdelay, 
My hoary father hopes our homeward way. 52© 

Indulge, great prince, our eager wifh to beai* 
The rapturous tidings to his longing ear. 
His foul rejoic'd will faille at nature's pains, 
Aud life flow fvvifter thiough his icy velni.

Bid us with fpeed our destin'd path refume, 52$, 

And biess a parent, finking in the tomb. 

He fpoke. Harefhah join'd the youth's request: 
Even Mina's eyes a fecret wifh confess'd. 
Jn love's kind heat, like ice in fummer's ray, 
All former ties, diflblving, pafs away ; 533 

To new-found friends the foul oblivious flies, 
New objects charm us, and new paflions rife. 
The Hero faw, and kindly bade depart 
The lov'd, the long-loft favourite of his heart ; 
With arms impaflion'd ctesp'd the bright-eyed fair, 535 
Kifs'd with fond look, and dropp'd a tender tear. 
On gay-dress'd camels, toward the fetting day, 
With converfe fweet, the lovers bent their way ; 
J. ike two fair flars, that ihed a lonely light, 
And fink in clouds, above the mountain's height. 54» 

Two feers their Heps attend, to point the way, 
That ends in mannong of uncharging day. 

And now, o'er all the camp, the rsjptar'd throng 
Crowd the wide plain, and wake th' enlivening fong. 
Here cheerful thousands bid the walls alcend ; 54$ 

And broad, and deep, the lengthening trenches bend. 
Here tnestrong arm the falchion learns to wield. 
Or hurls the javelin o'er the meafur'd field. 
With (bouts of praiie the conquerors oft are crown'd, 
And clanging bucklers fwell th' applauding found. ;^o 
Part, join'd in crowds, in mimic fight engage, 
Range their fmall hofts, and fport with teeming rage ; 
From force unequal here the vanquiihe fly ;

From tent to tent he urg'd his a£ive way, 

And blam'd with words fevere, the wild affray. 

Me, cried the hero, Israel's thoufands know 

A fair unchanging friend, or open foe. 

To generous war fince Israel's voice is given, 5^5 

To war I fly, and hope the fmiles of Heaven . 

Roufe then to arms ; for glorious fight prepare ; 

Each thought of peace, each terror vile forbear : 

Let glory's fire each warrior's breaft inflame, 

And deathless deeds fhall brighten Jacob's name. 57a 

Thus he. The wile the thoughtless thoufands drew, 
Snar'd by foft words, and caught by gilding fhew ; 
For war, invigor'd, glow'd th* undaunted mind, 
And kindling eye-balls with new luftre fliin'd. 
No walls they need, to flay th' impending foe; 575 

Yet, with light labour, fwift the barriers grow ; 
Hope high in view difplay'd unmeafur'd fpoil, 
Sooth'd every pain, and leflen'd every toil. 

As thus ferenely pafs'd the cheerful day, 
And care, and grief, oblivious roil'd away, 580 

At once fhrill rang, fromeaftern woods afar, 
The cry of foes, and growing found of war. 
The fporting warriors, prompt at dread alarms, 
C'eas'd from each game, and brac'd for fight their arms ;. 
O'er eaitern fields, with rapid fleps they hied. 58^

For whom, I cried, afcend yon glowing fires r 

What favourite firft-bom of th' angelic choirs ? 3C 

Thofe azure curtains ? that fublime abode ? 

A tent of glory forforae darling God ! 

Say, loveliefl Prince ! for thy fuperior mind

Why rove fo far th' unnumber'd flames on high ? 3^ 

Why cafl their endless bcr.uty through the fky ? 

Is yon blue frame, that limits morn and even, 

The fapphire pavement of fome nobler heaven ? 

Are flars but gems of unborn light, that fpread 

With duft of gold the ilreets where angels tread ? 40 

Or if for man tfhtfe works of glory mine, 

for earth-born reptiles furniture divine ;

In vain proud man, with self-applaufe runs o'er

And, self-inftru&ed, gains a nobler height. 50 

When from the deep, afcended earth, and heaven, 
To man, fole heir, the mighty boon was given. 
Unlike his fons, no guilt his mind deform'd ;

Or waves run rumbling under cavern'd mores, 
With murmuring noife, o'er western mountains came 
A broad, and dark-red meteor's" awful flame: 
Far o'er the woods, and plains, its fanguine hair 405 
Scream'd wild, and dreadful, on the burden'd air. 
As eaftern groves its leflening light abforb, 
Like thoufand thunders, burfts the rending orb ; 
Wide-fhooting flames the glimmering fky furround ; 
A gloomy glory fpreads the twilight ground ; 410 

L&ud o'er the world a long, hoarfe echo roars, 
And fad Can;ian groans through all her mores. 

Quick to the camp return'dth' aftonith'd pair, 
And half, in broken (lumbers, loft their care. 
O'er anxious Irad hovering vifiODS play'd, 41 c

When firfl through broken douds the morning (hin'd, 
In purpofe firm he fix'd his doubtful mind ; 420 

At Hezron's feet, with graceful reverence flood, 
And claim'd the biemr.g, e'er with joy bestow'd. 
With dawning fmiles, he bless'dhis lovely fon, 
jAnd fweet complacence round his afpest fhone. 
Will Hezron bend his ear ? the favourite cries— 42; 
Speak, my belov'd— th' indulgent fire replies. 

Thou know'if. my bofom feels the warrior's flame, 
Sighs for gay arms, and pants for generous fame; 
For Israel weeps, to aid her cause afpires, 
And burns tumultuous with restftless fires. 4 JO

In glory's bright career with heroes joia, 435 

And their fair names even now begin to mine. 
Grant, best of parents ! grant one blifsful day, 
And threefold duty (hall thy love repay. 

Why doft thou bring— the anxious fire replied— 
The dread request, my love has oft denied ? 44.0 

Why muft thy fire his favourite treafure lofe ? 
Why will thy heart the path of danger choofe ? 
That path, conceal'd where various evil lies, 
And the brave perifn, white the daftard flies.

Secure from (hame, enjoy thy hours ferene.

Like fome mild angel, sent from pitying Ccies, 

Shed dewy (lumbers on her languid eyes ; 

Jllum'd the grave, feren'd the rugged way, 

And cheer'd each fainting Hope of future day : 5^0 

Me from myself thy matchless duty Hole, 

And chain'd thee lovely to my inmost foul. 

Now to far regions is that parent gone, 
And, but for thee, thy fire were lest alone : 
From thee remov'd, no fecond self 1 know ; 5^3 

And, O bless'd favourite ! folitude is woe- 

When wing'd, my fweet companion trac'd her flight,. 
A wildering gloom obfcur'd the cheerful light ; 
Each joy was banifh'd from my hap'ess doom, 
And not a wifh remain'd me, but the tomb. 54» 

I-Ier tent, forfaken, feem'd in (hades to mourn ; 
i fer empty feat implored her bless'd return : 
Friends grac'd my board ; her vacant place I view'd ; 
Down rulh'd the tear, and every pang renew'd. 
Through difta-nt fields I roam'd ; the fields were fad : 
Ko more her prefencc bade the flowers be glad : 54$ 

A folemn twilight round all nature fpread, 
Drear a-; dun caves, that houfe the filent dead. 
Alone in crowds I flood, in fields alone ; 
My hope, my friend, my lovely folace gone. 55c 

But thou wail lest. In thy angelic face 
Sinil'd her lov'd image, glow'd her matchless grace : 
To thee I flew ; and, in thy duty, view'd 
iler power to charm, her wiih to bless, renew'd. 
That peace, the world bcfido could never give, 55 - 

J found in thee, and lov'd again to live.

On earth, if thou may'll live, I alk no more.

For, O fond Irad ! all the pride of Hate, 
Fair dreams, and painted bubbles, of the great, 
No real joy, no gentle peace, contain, 565 

But gay deceit, and undifcover'd pain. 
Whate'er in Wifdom prompts a vvilh to live, 
Soft, calm domestic scenes alone can give. 
Should'ft thou be fiain, even thefe muft cea&less mourn ; 
No joy betides me, and no hopes return ; 57a

Thus the great chief; and riling as he fpoke, 
In his right hand a fvvord fufpended took ;

And his fad eye-balls kindled at the view. 
Behold, brave yoath---with earnest voice he cried-— 585 
Thine is the fword, thy fire's, thy grandiire's pride ; 
By death of king?, and generous chiess, renown'd, 
With wreaths ennobled, and with triumphs crown'd. 
When Egypt's fons, on proud Sabea's plains, 
By Mofes guided, pour'd their countless trains ; 590 

High in his haughty car a chiestain rode, 
Bore down whole troops, and roll'd through brooks of blood; 
Deep in. his bread, while thoufands round him fell, 
Thy generous Grandiire lodg'd this mining Heel ; 
Then ceas'd the fight ; Sabea's millions fled, 595 

And the earth groan'd beneath the piles of dead.

To Jaha2' deathless field when Sihon drew, 

When combat thicken'd, and when dangers grew, 

This arm, this falchion clave the monarch's fide, 

And low on earth abas'd his impious pride. 600 

From Kezron's hand the honour'd gift embrace, 
Dread of thy foes, and glory of thy race ; 
And while thy arm their weapon learns to wield, 
Let the fame fpirit prompt thee to the field. 
Each wildexcest, each ufeless danger fhun ; u 605 

But firft in virtue's courfe aufpicious run : 
Outftrip thy peers ; To Jolhna's height afpire ; 
Let real glory all thy wifhes fire : 
Let mine, my fire's, my tribe's, my nation's fame 
Imbibe new fplendors from thy added name. 610 

Yet not one fear my boding mind alarms, 
Lest Irad's deeds diftain his parent's arms ; 
1 know thy generous mind ; and, fore' d to yield, 
Aflur'd, behold thee grace th' embattled field. 
And oh ! wilt thou, whofe hand from every foe 6:5 

My life prefcrv'd, and footh'd in every woe, 
My darling for. defend ! from thee he came ; 
Scarce born, I gave him to th' eternal Name ; 
Thine are his virtues ; round his youthful head 
A guardian (hield may thy good angel fpread. 620 

Thus fpoke the chief. In Irad's feeiirg foul 
A ftrangc, tumultuous joy began to roll : 
As oft t' unfold hip grateful heart he tried, 
The fuffbeated founds in filence died.' 
Downdropp'd the fword ; and flrait, with homage due. 
The Youth enkindling from the tent withdrew ; C26 

Quick to the lovely fair-one trae'd his \ 
And flrove the tumult of his thoughts t' allay. 
Her in th* tent, with maidens compafs'd round, ■ 
Sflecl companions ofher fports,he found. 630 

There, fwectW wclcom'd with inflinelive fmile*, 
He fmooth'd his face with new, but harmless wiles,

And, while foft art her tender mind preparM, 

His own design, his fire's conscnt declar'd. 

With guarded lips he fpoke ; but dire furprize 635 

Pierc'dher fad heart, and .gloom'd her ftarry eyes; 

With one deep figh, fhe felt her ftrength decay, 

Slid to the ground, and breath'd her life away. 

Quick to her aid the Youth impaffion'd flew: 

And, with the virgins, bade her life renew; 640 

Again reviv'd the fplendor of her eye, 

And ting'd her cheek with health's tranfeendent die. 

O best belov'd ! with tender voice he faid— - 

Let not such anguifh wound my beauteous maid ! ■— 

Let cheerful hope thy timorous thoughts infpire, 645 

And thine eye languifh with a brighter fire ! 

When o'er my head a few {hort days (hall roll, 
My hastening feet muft reach th' appointed goal ; 
To manhood grown, the law, from heaven reveal'd, 
Refiftless calls me to th' imbattled field. 650 

If IfraePs fons my falchion earlier ciaim, 
And kindly fummon to the path of fame, 
Why ihould'ft. thou mourn ? 'tis duty points the way ; 
When duty calls us, fafety bids obey. 

Thou know'il when evening last the ikies attir'd, 655 
The fage, reproving, generous thoughts infpir'd ; 
Firft from his mouth my nation's choice I knew; 
And fwift to war my foul obfequious flew : 
No place, no hope, to vile delay was given ; 
The call of nations is. the call of Heaven*. 66& 

Led by his voice, I trail his guardian care ; 
With equal cafe he faves in peace, and war. 
The fame good hand, that thro* the woodland made, 
To friends, to fafety, loveliest Mina led, 
Though thoufands fall, may Irad's bofom mield, 665 
And wing th* averted javelin through the feld.

Sate filent, folemn, fix'd in mournful gaze : 67? 

With tendered action on her looks he hung, 

And thus vain folace tunes again his tongue. 

But, doom'd to fall, fhould Heaven my life dema: i, 
And death betide me from a heathen's hand, 
I fall in virtue'-; cause. Far harpier do 
In that biess'd path, to find a fpec .

To drag a worthless life, and fwell in glorious c. .

In that far clime, where joy extends her reign, 
My pinion'd foul fhall fpring to life again ; 
Strong with empyreal youth, mall trace her way, 
And join the nations of immortal day. 
Thence, when thy form isfummon'd to the tomb, 685

And face averted, fate the liftening fair. 
While the deep woe her feeling boibm mourn'd,, 
With a long, heavy figh, me thus return'd. 
With boding heart I heard the fage's tale, 695 

But felt fond hopes the dire design would fail ; 
That Hezron's choice, i'o often tried in vain, 
Would ftill confine thee from the fatal plain. 
Yet thy lov'd maid, with gentle words, design'd 
To change thy wifh, and footh thy eager mind* 70s

The CONQUEST op CANAAN,

NOW dawning light conceal'd the world's on high, 
And morn in beauty cloth'd the cloudless fky : 
Loud o'er the field the trump's fhrill found began, 
And fwift to arms the flartled thoufands ran ; 
From all the camp burft forth the numerous throng, 5 
Shook their tall fpears, and wak'd the martial fong ; 
Wide wav'd their plumes, refulgent flafh'd their fhields, 
And fpiry banners trembled o'er the fields, 
South of the camp, in two deep fquares they Hood, 
And fierce for combat, fac'd the plain of blood. 1© 

Before the western band great Hezron rofe, 
Joy of his race, and terror of his foes : 
Averfe from pomp, in ufeful fleel array'd, 
Fieas'd, his iuft ranks the mighty chief furvey'd y 
Pleas'd to the well-known field of combat drew ; 1^ 

When duty call'd, his foul no terror knew 

Of equal ftrength battalions eaftward flood. 
And high in front exalted Jofhua ftrode. 
By nature fafhion'd millions to controul, 
In peace, in war, the great all-moving foul, 20 

His mind expanded look'd exiftence through j 
His heart undaunted danger never knew ; 



, 5 6 BOOK V. 

Go, firft of youths, defend thy Maker's laws, tf$ 

And lift the falchion, in thy country's cause. 
May God's good hand thy tender footfleps guard, 
With caution bless thee, and with fame reward '. 

He fpoke> and kindly raptur'd Irad rear'd ; 
His fwimming eye the grateful mind declar'd ; loo 

Swift he return'd, on high his fhield difplay'd, 
Shook his bluefword, and thought the fight delay'd. 

Near the bless'd scene enraptur'd Hezron flood, 
And life ran nimbler thro' his languid blood ; 
Charm'd with the kind regard, to Irad given, iO£ 

He kneel'd to earth, and bless'd all-bounteous Heaven, 
That Heaven which gave, his every wifh to crown, 
The Chief to lfrael, and to him thefon. 

Now, rang'd for combat, wait the warrior bands, 
And his brave leaders Jofhua thus commands— II© 

'Till this right hand exalt the javelin bright, 
Let every rank conduct a mimic flight : 
Slow, firm, and clofe, be mov'd the fair retreat ; 
Nor wing'd with ruin wild, and foul defeat :

Smird horrid o'er the scene, nor knew to drop a tear.

With various arms in one great hoft combin'd, 
And various banners ftreaming ori the wind. 1 c6 

'Gainft Jofhua's hod the chief imperious ftrode,

Mov'd by his ceafeless fighs for martial faffie, 

His royal fire the parent's fears o'ercame. 

Reluctant sent him to the deathful plain, 

And fondly hop'd his lovely ileps again. 17^ 

There pleas'd with fame's imaginary charms. 

He clafp'd the phantom in his eager arms, 

On the biight glories turn'd a raptur'd eye, 

And gaz'd, and gar*d, and fancied Mift was nigh. 

Now, mid the grandeur of the deep array, If 5 

A dreadful fpace in gloom tremendous lay : 
No banner* wave in air, nor trumpet's found ; 
But filent terror faddens all the ground. 
Load burft the clarion's voice, and trembling far,

And ilreams of crimfon die th' embattled ground. 

Meantime, fierce Hanniel, bjrning ftilj for fame, 205 
And fickening fliil at Jofhua's envied name, 
Deem'd this the destin'd hour, to pluck the crown 
From the Chief's head, and plant it on his own. 
Oh heaven, he cried, fhall Jfrael ever fiee, 
The dupe of cunning, and the coward's prey ? 210 

Mull thefe pain'd eyes again our ruin view, 
Curfe our wild counscls, and our follies rue ? 
Come every generous chief, whofe bofom brave 
To foul difgrace prefers a hero's grave, 
Join Hanniel's path ; and foon proud Ai mall fee 215 
A few, bold warriors yet difdain to fiee. 
Whate'tr my vo'ce commands, my hand mall dare, 
My deeds unfpotted, as my dictates fur ; — 
Far nobler doom, to fall in manly fight, 
Than (hare, with titled names in fplendid flight.--- ' 220 
This fai J, his courfe the hero forward bends, 
No chief applauds him, and no chief attends : 
Two vulgar warriors, fad rebuff to pride 1 
Alone rum on, and clamour at his fide. 
Their daunt'ess courfe their rantur'd foes defcry, 225 

And well-aim'd lances glitter thro' the fky ; 
Thick round the warriors, finks the biffing fteel, 
And death's cold hand the brave attendants feel ; 
fa Hanniel's thigh expands a painful wound, 
And the ftunn'd hero racing bites the ground. 230 

Swift to his aid, impaiTion'd, joiliua fiew,- 
Tho' well proud Hanniel's dark designs he knew, 
Heard all the vaunts, the dole iinniiice faw, 
And felt th' infractions of his prudent law : 
Yet now the chief lay weltering in his gore ; 235 

Foes in diftress to him were tees no more— 
O'er the pale form he threw his guardian fhield, 
And bore him languid thro : the dreadiui rieid :

Thick mower the Hones, the flaming javelins fing ; 
And his bright arms with ceafeless murmurs ring. 24C 
Borne by four warriors o'er the difhnt plain, 
Relu&ant Hanniel fought the camp again : 
There friendly plants his dying ftrength renew, 
And fleep's foft influence aids the balmy dew. 
While Jofhua thus— Hence taught, ye warriors, kno\v,245 
Wild, headftorng wiflies guide to certain woe, 
In peace, laws only claim a righteous fway ; 
In war, one voice commands, the rest obey. 
Proud difobedience Heaven consigns to mame j 
The path of duty leads alone to fame. 25c 

He fpoke— With awe the filent fquadrons heard, 
The precept reverenc'd, and the teacher fear'd ; 
Each faw, abam'd, the terrors of his frown, 
And pleas'd, condemned rebellion, not his own. 

Meantime, brave lrad, on the weilern plain, 25 j 

With pangs retir'd from Ai's contemptuous train. 
As oft th' imperious taunt his rage infpires, 
And his fcorch'd bofom flames with eager fires, 
Their utmost llrength his vengeance promps to try, 
He longs, he pants, to bid th' infulters fly : 260 

Qft toward the hoft his courfe inftin&ive turns ; 
His drawn fword trembles, and his buckler burns ; 
But ftill his foul, in child-hood taught t' obey, 
Re/trains the wiili, and backward turns his way.

And Ai triumphant cnas'd th' imagin'd flight, 
When pay in dazzling arms, great jolhua turn'd :

Brace the Itrong hand ; the bloody falchion wing ; 

See, Heaven's propitious finger points the way I 

Fear chains their limbs, and terror yields the prey ; 

O'er our glad courfe commencing grory (miles. 

And boundless treafures crown triumphant toils. 28a 

He fpoke ; the warriors eyed th' exalted sign ; 
And thrilling bofoms own'd the voice divine ;

Red lances fhower, and fhouts cpnvulfe the Ikies, 
An equal ardour Ai undaunted brings, l%$ 

Fronts the dire foe, and fierce to danger fprings— 
As, borne by warring winds, thro* ether roll 
Two riling ftorms, and cloud the northern pole ; 
O'erfome dark mountain's head their volumes driven 
With floods of livid lightening deluge heaven ; 290 

Peal following peal, careering thunders fly, 
Burft o'er the world, and rend the muddering {ky. 
With equal noife the florms of war refound ; 
The blackening volumes cloud the hoftile ground ; 
Thro' the fhoc~:'d air in mingled tumult rife, 29^ 

The conqueror's triumphs, and the victim's crid6. 

And now the chief to prudent Caleb's charge, 
While the cloud thickens, and the founds enlarge, 
Commends the hoft that own his mighty fway, 
And bends to diftant rocks his backward way. 300 

Here high in air he lifts the lance's beam, 
And power divine fupplies a ceafeless ftream ; 
With pointed circles glows the weapon brighc, 
And calls th' effulgence of exceilive light, 

Long o'er the plain, impatient to purfue, 30^ 

Had panting Irad fix'd an anxious view, 
Sigh'd the great Leader's warning voice to hear, 
Or catch the radiance of th' expected fpear :

But when the fun-bright point imUrr'd the air, 3 1 5 

The blooming hero kenn'd the beam afar ; 
To his brave peers, with ardent joy he cries, 
And all th© warrior fparkled in his eyes. 
Lo, generous youths, on yon delightfome plain

Thro" his chiil'd veins a new, ftrange horror ran, 

And half-form'd tears in either eye began 5 

In his young heart, unusM to create woe, 

Inflictive fyrnpathy began to glow ;

Spurns the fierce florin, and mocks the wafte of time. 

Far diftant, Caleb fwept the crimfon plain, 3S5 

Guided the fight, and pil'd the numerous flain ; 
Round his great arm the cloudy fquadrons hung ; 
ClafrVd on his buckler countless weapons rung ; 
Chiess after chiess oppos'd his waiting courfe, 
Met his broad ft.el, and felt its fatal force. 396 

Ludon,the Hivites' prince, his arm defied 
All rough with gold, and gay in barbarous pride ; 
With giant flrength the heathen hurl'd his fpear, 
Jts terrors quivering through the parted air; 
Loud o'er brave Caleb's moulders fung the fteel, 395 

And pierc'd a warrior's bread ; the warrior fell ; 
His blue mail clang'd ; to rife he tried in vain> 
But writh'd in dying anguifh on the plain. 
The mighty leader rais'd his fword on high, 
Its tranfient lightnings circling in the iky, 466 

Full on the Heathen's neck a griding wound

Amaz'd, the Hivites faw their monarch loft. 
And deathlike murmurs groan/d around thehoft. 

Near the bold leader Oran rear'd his fteel, 405 

Where the florm thicken'd, and the fiercest fell ; 
Imperious taunts provoke the rage cf war, 
Loud threats infult, and tumult founds 3far ; 
Wedg'd in a moveless throng, the battle grows, 
Cries deeper roar, and fhriller ring the blows. <* ;o 

With joy, unfeeling Oran ftrides the flain, 
And hails the ruins of th' accuflom'd plain : 
No anguifh melts, no wound his pity charms. 
No fate impaflions, and no groan alarms ; 
Thro' the red scenes he hews a raptur'd wnv, 41 -

The hero fpoke ; and urg'd by pailion's force, 
On furious Carmi bent his aged courlc ; 
Awful in gleam of arms, the chiess appear, 
Here the bold youth, the white-hair'd hero there: 46a 

But ere his fword great Hezron could extend, 
Or circling bands their ancient chief defend, 
A long, bright lance his wary foe beheld, 
And fnatch'd it glittering on the bloody field ; 
Swift through the hero's fide he fore'd the fteel ; 465 

Pierc'd to the heart, the aged wtfirior fell ; 
There lay, a corfe, bespread with purple llains, 
The form, that triumph'don a hundred plains. 

On Ridgefield's hills, to fliame to virtue dead, 
Thus daitard bands the foe inglorious fled ; 476 

"When Wooiter fingly brav'd the deathfui ground, 
Fir'd hofts in vain, and met the fatal wound. 
In dangers born, to arms in childhood train'd, 
From Gallia's heroes many a palm he gain'd ; 
With freedom's facred flame ferenely glow'd 175 

For juilice arm'd, and fought the field for God ; 
With Heady zeal his nation's interell lov'd ; 
(No terror touch'd him, and no injury mov'd) 
Far in the front, with dauntleis bo(om bled, 
And crown'd the honours of his hoary head. 480 

Bent o'er his foe, the lovely Carmi flood, 
And view'd, with tears of grief, his burfting blood ; 
And thus— -Unhappy fire, he fadly cried— 
Perhaps thy monarch's joy, tby nation's pride.— 
How like my father's bends thy hoary brow ? 485 

His limbs, his countenance, and his locks offnow, 
All in thy venerable face I fee—

BOOK VI, H7 

His voice, his eyes the joyful hofc infpire, 
And through the fweetness flames a dreadful fire. 
Active as light, o'er trembling ranks he hung ; 
Shouts fhook the plains, the frighted fDrefis rung : 
Unnumber'd fullen groans were heard around ; 495 

Unnumber'd corfes cloath'd the purple ground: 
From port to poll r-etir'd pale Judah's train, 
And chief on chief increas'd the piles offiain. 
Dark as an evening cloud, bold Ai was driven, 
Gloom'd all the fields, and cafl a (hade on heaven ; 500 
Wide roli'd the ftorm ; wide drove the duft along, 
And ruin hover'd o'er the flying throng. 

Meantime, brave Irad turn'd his fparkling eyes, 
And faw in diftant fields the clouds arife ; 
Sad flight and terror fillM the backward plain, 505 

And the foe fhouted o'er hi3 kindred flat 11. 
As, when autumnal clouds the fkies deform, 
Burfts the wild whirlwind from the gloomy ftorm ; 
Hoawfe crafh the pines ; oaks fliffiy ftubborn fall, 
And fudden thunders liftening fwains appall : $\q 

So, wing'dby Heaven, impetuous Irad flew; 
As fwift their darling chief the youths purfb.e ; 
Whelm'd in their path, the falling bands expire, 
And crowds of warriors from their fteps retire. 

Now, where brave Carmi fwept the purple ground. 
Terrific Irad fhook his buckler's round ; 5 i5 

Alike in years they feem'd, alike in arms, 
Of equal ftature, and of rival charms : 
Nor this, nor that, the dangerous fight can yield ; 
But each demands the empire of the field. 520 

From the fierce chiess the wondering bands retreat ; 
Blows following blows their founding fhields repeat; 
Unclest, each faithful orb the ftroke rebounds, 
Blunts the keen blade, and intercepts the wounds : 
'Till Irad's nimble arm, with fudden wheel, 525 

Through Carmi's fide imoels the fatal Heel,

Pure ftreams of crimfon ftain the fubjett ground, 
An J the freed foul pervades the gaping wound. 

Not that fair pride, that foul-fupporting flame, 
That lights the fplendors of th' immortal name ; $yi 

Not all the bravery nature can impart, 
Nor the fond wifhes of a virgin's heart, 
Nor parents' vows, nor nations' prayers could lave, 
The young, bright hero from an early grave. 
He fell, with beauty's fairest beams adorn'd, 535 

While foes admir'd him, and while Irad mourn'd. 
Ah youth, too foon allotted to the tomb ; 
Oh had kind Heaven difpens'd afofter doom, 
On thy fair deeds a fweet reward bcfiow'd, 
And op' d the manfions of the bless'd abode ! 540 

Thus, where fad Charlestown lifts her hills on high, 
"Where once gay ftructures charm'd the morning fky, 
Ere Howe's barbarian hand in favage tire 
Wrapp'd the tall dome, and whelm'd the facred fpire, 
In life's fair prime, and new to war's alarms, 545 

Brave Warren funk, in all the pride of arms. 
With me, each generous mind the hour recall, 
When pale Columbia mourn'd her favourite's fall ; 
Mourn'd the bright flatefman, hero, patriot, fled, 
The friend extinguim'd, and the genial dead ; 550 

While he, the darling of the wife, and good, 
Seal'd his firm truth, and built his name in biocd. 

Loud as the ruming ftorm, the din of war 
Burft o'er the plain, and fh'.ok the fields afar ;

Aloft in air a Lion's gloomy form 

Lower'd, like the darkness of a fullen florm ; 

Around his head his fcaggy terrors frown'd, 565 

And his red eyeballs gleam'd destrudtion round. 

Swift from the bearer's hand fierce Irad drew 

The banner'd ftaff, and mid the heathens threw ; 

Withjoy they fprang to feize the glittering prize, 

And fmiles of triumph fparkled in their eyes. 570 

Shame flufh'd the checks of Judah's glowing train ; 

Their bofoms heav'd ; their faces flafh'd difdain ; 

To feize the mining fpoil each warrior fprang ; 

The combat thicken'd ; and all ether rang ; 

Far roll'd the darkness of the dully clcud ; 5-5 

Loud rofe their cries, and armour claiVd aloud. 

The blackening tempest Ai undaunted kenn'd, 

Plcas'd to procure, and ftubborn to defend ; * 

Scarce Irad's arm could cleave the firm-wcdg'd train, 

As fierce he drove the ftandard to regain ; 580 

Through ranks on ranks he foic'd a fanguine way, 

Ere his red falchion won the fplendid prey ; 

Wirh fmiles, he faw the crimfon tumult grow,

And rofe to fave the triumphs of the field ; 
But foon new incuts afcend the clouded iky, 
His friends now triumph, and the Heathens fly. 590 

Now nearer scenes his fearching view demand, 
Where mighty Caleb rules the warrior band ; 
Fierce Oran's fword begins inglorious flight, 
And his loud clamours animate the fight: 
Scarce Caleb's arm the conflicl can fuftain, 595 

His voice aroufe, or deeds infpire, the train ; 
So fierce the heathens throng th' embattled ground, 
So thick the warriors fall, the groans refound.

Swift as a rapid whirlwind, rufh'd along ; 602 

As 'gainfl: a mound, when tempests rice the gale, 

The raging river foams along the vale ; 

Down the wall crumbles, and with dreadful reign 

Sweeps a wild deluge on the wafted plain. 

Buriting upon the dark embodied throng 60- 

Thus the wide ruin jofhua drove along ; 

Around his conrfe increas'd the piles of dead, 

The brave funk f ghting, and the coward fled. 

Now, where unfeeling Oran crufn'd the f.ain, 
All grim with du fl:, and red with many a flain, 6i* 

While fmiles o r *ranfport gather'd on his brow, 
Hi? fierce eye fparkling o'er the bleeding foe, 
While high for death he rear'd his fanguine arm, 
And a brave warrior bow'd to fhun the ltorm, 
Great Jofhua's full-orb'd buckler caught the wound, 615 
And lightnings darted from the moony round, 
Then, by his hand with rufhing thunder thrown, 
On Oran's helmet burfl a mighty P.one, 
That, bounding onward 'gainft a warrior's fide, 
Crufh'd his ftrong ribs, and lh.ed a plenteous tide. 62 G 
Stunn'd by the daggering blow, the ieader fell, 
Wn'th'd with the pain, and gave a hideous yell ; 
Furious he lay, with heaving, panting breath, 
RolFd up his whitening eve<. and frown'd in death ; 
Curfing the fhield, which feiz'd his nimble dart, 625 

And ftopp'd itspaflage to the warrior's heart : 
Swift on his throat defcends th' indignant blade, 
Burfts the black gore, and leans the gri.ly head.

Wealth, and fair peace, the generous conteil yields, 635 

And wreachs of glory bloom in bloody fields. — 

As in th' enkindled wood fierce winds arife, 

And ftorms of fire are blown acrois the fkies ; 

In blazing trains, the towering pines defcend, 

And ruining thunders all the foreit rend : 640 

So, loud and furious, Israel throng'd the fight, 

And their blue armour flafh'd a dreadful light; 

O 'er the pale rear tremendous Jofnua hung ; 

Their gloomy kneil his voice terrific rung ; 

From glowing eyeballs rlafh'd his wratli fevere, 64J 

Grim Death before him hurl'd his murdering (pear ; 

Heads, fever'd from their necks, bestrew'd his way, 

And gufning bodies round his foocileps lay. 

Meantime Ai's founding portals wide unfold, 
And fierce to combat buriting bands are roil'd ; 650 

In dreadful pomp aicends the widening train; 
Battalions on battalions cloud the plain : 
There glowing Zimri wings his rapid force, 
And eager thoufands darken round his courfe, 

Ai's ghaftly fons the fmoking walls furvey'd, 65 £ 

And wild amaze each pallid front array'd ; 
Here lay in gore their brethren, and their iires ; 
There funk their manfions in terrific fires; 
Before, behind, their foes increas'd alarms ; 659 

They rais'd one fhriek, and dropp'd their ufeless arms : 
Where'er an opening rank receiv'd the day, 
Or dull obfeure difclos'd a glimmering ray, 
Borne by light fear, they lest the lingering wind, 
They fled, they flew, nor cait a look behind ; 
Oft on the fpear's protended point they ran ; C6t 

While throng'd refilliess, meeting man with man, 
Steel itretch'd to fteel, and ihield to ihieid eppoo'd ; 
On every fide the power of lfrael clos'd. 
So thick they throng'd, no fpear could mifs its courfe ;

So, when tall navies Ji Ft imperial fails, 

And hope th' indulgence of propitious gales,

Heav'd from the bottom, foaming billows rife, 

And climb, and climb, and roar agair.it the fkies ; 

O'er fhiver'd malfo unroll the furging waves,

Swift as a whirlwind, o'er thefouthern plain, 

Impetuous Zimri drove the Hivite train:

Sunk in the wood, and vanifiVd from the fight. 

And now, obedient to the Chief's command, 63 ~ 

(Round the tall ftandard throng'd each wearied band; 
A fmile of tranfport every face adorn'd,

Stain'd with black dult, and piere'dwith many a woui*d, 
Stiff gore besprinkling all his locks of fnow, 6^5 

And a cold cloud around his reverend brow, 
Hezron appear'd : at once his nerves congeal'd ; 
His frozen lips a dumb, dead illence fcal'd ; 
A moveiess (latue, o'er the fire he hung, 
Nor dreaming tears releas'd his marbled tongue. 70* 
Then round the corfe impaflion'd arms he threw, 
And walh'd the clotted gore in filial dew ; 
Glu'd to the form ui:h itrong embraces lay.

The CONQUEST of CANAAN. 
BOOK VII. 



O'ER the wide world immeafurablv fpread, 
Night, ftili and gloomy, caft a fclemn (hade. 
In heavens half-clouded liars unfrequent hang ; 
Scarce heard, the blast with mournful murmurs rung ; 
Above tall, eatfern hills, the moon's pale eye 5 

Look'd fad, and dreadful, from the cheerless fky : 
Her cold, w an face, half- hid behind a cloud, 
That wrapp'd the mountains in a fable fhroud, 
With feeble luflre ftreak'd the ihadowy plains. 
And edg'd her vapoury robes with dismal iiains. 10 

All, but thefavage race, to fieep recir'd, 
And the last gleams of western ikies expir'd. 

Stretch'd in his tent, unhappy Irad lay, 
And fad oblivion bore his toils away. 
In that ftill hour, when rapt on eagle-wings, 1 5 

To diftant climes bewilder'd fancy fprings, 
A death-like flumber feal'd his tearful eyes, 
And thus unreal scenes in vifion rife. 

Through ionely fields, in ruflet gloom array'd, 
Loft in mute grief, with weary tfeps he ftray'd. 20 

A fhadowy light, like evening's dufky ray, 
Spread o'er the world, and form'd a twilight day. 
Beiore his, wandering path, a northern grove 
Sh^d midnight round, and pierc'd the clouds above ; 



i 5 3 B o o k vir. 

Slow wav*d the tall, dark pines : a hollow found 2 • 

Roli'd through the wood, and ihook th' autumnal ground. 
Dull-murmuring fell the fallen, fwelling dreams, 
Lulling to fleep, and blue in glimmering beams. 
With broad, black horrors o'er its bofom fpread, 
An eaftern mountain rear'd its maggy head ; 3Q 

High hung the hoary cliff; the cedars height, 
hess feen, and less, withdrew beyond the fight. 
Strange unknown scenes the regions wild difplay, 
And folitary mufic /lowly dies away. 

From the thick grove, in dark-brown robes reveal'd, 
A form ftalk'd folemn o'er tne muddering field ; 36 

Of other worlds he feem'd ; nor cart an eye 
On the brown plain, or on the gleomy fky. 
Regardless of the scenes that round him mourn 'd, 
On Irad's path his fad, flow fteps he turn'd ; 40 

Pale flood the Youth ; the ftately fhape drew nigh ; 
Gafh'd was his cheek, andfix'd his lofty eye ; 
Take a light flame, low hung his beard of fnow, 
And death's cold terrors hover'd or. his brow. 
'Twas Hezron's self. With weak, but folemn found, 45 
As fullen graves beneath the foot refound, 
HU voice began-~On fate's dark verge I ftand, 
Whence thickening dangers roll acrofs thy land. 
Night wraps the world ; approaching dorms arife, 
Hang o'er thy race, and cloud the fouthern ikies. 50 

My mouldering bones a colder night detains, 
Ci.js'd in the tomb, and bound in icy chain* : 
Cut the wing'd fpirit fairer climes furround, 
And heaven unfolding bids her longs ictbund. 
Faintly hespoke. By itrange, immortal fpell, 5$

And with liroug life his changing eye infpir'^ ; 
O'er his white robes a purple fplendor ray'd ; 
JLong glittering pinions looi'ely round him plsy'J ; 6c 



BOOK VII, 15J 

In dreadful pomp, fublime the Viiion flood, 
And living fragrance breath'd along the wood. 
At once the hero, ftartled, rais'd his head ; 
Still was his tent, and all the tumult fled ; 
Again to ileep heclos'd his wearied eyes, 6$ 

And broken {lumbers o'er his toils arife. 

Sudden, his name re-echoing from the walls, 
A wild, and vifionary murmur calls— 
Irad awake ; my voice thine ear invades^ 
From the dark manfions of imprifon'd lhades ; 70 

In fouthern plains the clarion's thunders rife, 
Andfhouts of triumph fill the rending ikies. 

Swift from his couch the Youth altonifh'd rofe, 
(While every vein the dreadful murmur froze) 
With aclive hand his arms around him brac'd ; 75 

With nimble feet the glimmering champain pafs'd, 
And tow'rd Ai's flames, that rag'd with awful force, 
Su(pcn(G, but fearless, fleer'd his lonely courfe. 
Still o'er his head the airy phantom hung ; 
Irad awake---the voice unreal rung : 80 

Sad grief, and anxious doubt his thoughts oppreis'd^ 
But love's foft whifpers full diftu'rb'd his breaii. 

Now folemn filence fail'd along the air ; 
No bird complain'd ; no echoing voice was near 5 
Save the flow murmur of the palling gale, 83 

That fwept the plain, and founded through the vale. 
The flames dark-glimmer'd on the hero's IhieH, 
And caft long fhadows o'er the pallid field : 
Round the dread scenes he turn'd regardless eyes, 
And thus began, witk intermingled frghs--- $© 

And art thou fled forever r this thine end, 
Thou bed of parents, and thou furest friend? 
And could'ft thou fall, a prey to murdering war ? 
What cruel demon drove my feet fo far r 
Was no kind angel hovering o'er the throng ? e*£ 

Where look'd the Power, thy virtue ferr'd folong?

Thy foal Co pure— thy life Co firmly jufl— 
Scarce Heaven's own law could more demand from dud. 
"Why, O thou righteous Mind ? but ceafe my tongue, 
Nor blame the dread decree, that cannot wrong. ice 

Mine the fole fault---and mine the fingle blame- 
Wild with the magic of that phantom, fame. 
Didft thou for this the guilty fhield bellow, 
To leave thee naked to the fatal blow ? 
Didft thou for this the fword accurs'd impart, 105 

That fhould have plung'd beneath the murderer's heart ? 
Far other love, far other faithful cares 
Nurs'd my young limbs, and watch'd my riling years ; 
My early ileps, from pleafure's flippery road, 
Lur'd with foft fmiles, and led them up to God ; lie 
Thy own bright acYions prompting to purfue. 
To virtue charm'd me, and to glory drew; 
With Jofiuii's self my willies forc'd to vie, 
Boaft: of mankind, and chofenofthe Sky . 

Pale, in the vifionsof the guilty bed, 11^ 

Thy form affrights me, and thine eyes upbraid. 
There scenes of dire diflress thy words unroll, 
Doom'd for my life, and opening on my foul. 
Or does thy mind its lov'd employ purfue, 
To guard from ill, and hidden dangers mew ? 129 

Perhaps thy thoughts, beyond the filent tomb, 
Watch, as in life, thy nation's iecret doom ; 
Some rufhing fate unknown diiccrn afar, 
Some threatening ambufti, cr fome wafting war. 

Perhaps the firft of maids thy care demands, ! 25 

And claims her fafety from aerial hands. 
Ah ! knew the fair w-hat crimes to me belong. 
Her lovely voice had fpar'd th* applauding fong; 
A breaH more pure her melting aims embrae'd, 
And the bight garland worthier temples grae'd. 1 ;c 

Thus fpoke the chief, when now his ftepi were nigh 
Ai's awfil) Jl-irics, that wav'd acrofs the iky ; 



BOOK VIL *6i 

All pale, and gloomy, climb'd the dreadful blaze, 
And fmoky volumes curl'd above the rays ; 
A dreary gleam enroll'd the fhady ground, 135 

And the brown land-fcape faintly rofe around. 
Touch'd by the folemn scene, the hero cried-— 
Where hapless Ai ! is now thy towery pride ? 
Where now the manly fons, whofe finewy arms 
Rofe, a drong bulwark 'gainfl: impending harms 140 

Where now the heaven-topp'd fpire ? the gilded wall ? 
Thy kings, thy heroes ? whelm'd in ruin all— - 
Deflruttion's clouds fail'd blackening o'er thy light, 
And wide oblivion's never-ertding night. 

Where yon tall dome fhoots forth the greedy flame, 14^ 
Perhaps fome hero hop'd a deathless name. 
Oft when return'd from war, his tender race 
Climb'd his fond knee and afe'd the fweet embrace : 
Oft, with a parent's gliftening eye, he view'd 
His face, his virtues in their forms renew'd* I50 

Perhaps fome daughter, darling of his care, 
Beam'd, like Selima fairest of the fair : 
And could thofe flames fome lovely majd destroy, 
A nation's glory and a parent's joy ? 
Could babes, fweet-fmiling, claim no hand to fave, if* 
But find, unwept, a furnace for a grave ? 

Thus mourn'd his generous heart the doom fevere, 
And paid loft Ai the tribute of a tear. 
Like ocean's long, deep roar, a rufhing found 
Burft from the wood, and pour'd along the ground ; \Co 
At once wide trembled o'er the awful fields 
The fudden gleam of fpears, and helms, and fliields, 
Impetuous roll'd unfeen the rattling car, 
And banner'd terrors wav'd th* approach of war. 
Loud rung bold Jrad's voice ; the dreadful found 16$

The cry wav'd folemn through the winding vales ;

The ibuthern guards Toon caught the boding found, 

And fpread th* alarm the ftartled camp around ; 

Loud as tall billows rend the rocky more, 

Rofe the fonorous clarion's barfting roar : 

Swift to the camp the hero wing'd his way, 175 

Rous'd all the holt, and fcatter'd wild dismay —

Swift to thefe tents urmumber'd bands repair ; 

Hark ! how the trumpet fills the troubled air I 180 

In fouthern fields afcends the wafting war, 

And fierce as whirlwinds rolls the rapid car. 

Arm, ere our camp be wrapp'd in one broad flame, 

And Israel's manly thoufands want a name, 

Thus, round the holt, his animating cry 185 

Urg'd fleep's oblivious hand from every eye ;

Now, rang'd in ranks, the hoft expestant flood, 205 
Prepar'd for combat, fteel'd to death and blood ; 
Sudden, before the Chief, with pantiog breaft, 
The generous Youth preferr'd his bold request— = 
Near Ai's red flames I fteer'd my careless way, 
Robb'd of wifh'd llumbers, and to grief a prey, 2 1 o 

When flieath'd in gleaming arms, a mighty train, 
Pour'd from the wood, and cover'd all the plain : 
On foaming courfers, chiess impel the war, 
Or whirl the terrors of the wafting car. 
And wilt thou, Chief divine, from lrad hear 2 1 g 

The dictates of a mind, that knows no fear ? 
Shall this young arm again the lance command. 
And lead to fight a ftrong, undaunted band, 
To Ai's wide ruins wing our active courle, 
And tempt the fury of barbarian force r 220 

Shall thine unconquer'd fvvord the camp defend, 
And ward the fate, if fname our fteps attend f 
Safe in thy prudence (hall the race endure, 
And Jofhua's name our wives, agd fons fecure. 
Lo, dress'd in fteel, we wait thy ruling breath ! 225 

Counfel is ruin, and delay is death. 
Go, in Jehovah's name-— the Chief replied--- 
Forth ftalk'd the Youth, and warm'd with martial pride ; 
O'er fouthern fields the bands appointed fteer'd, 
Squar'd in juit ranks, and not a warrior fear'd. 230 

Now where Ai's fons bestrew'd the plain, they came, 
Faintly iilumin'd by the diftant flame ; 
No foe appear'd : the world more gloomy grew, 
And, loft in clouds, etherial realms withdrew ; 
Save where lone ftars difFus'd a feeble beam, 235 

Like the far taper's folitary gleam : 
Slow winds breath'd hollow through the dark profound. 
And deepening horror brooded o'er the ground.

Their breafls impatient for the scenes of blood : 
On every face a death-like glimmer fate, 245 

The unbiess'd harbinger of inftant fate. 
High thro* the. gloom, in pale and dreadful fpires, 
Rofe the long terrors of the dark-red fires ; 
Torches, and torrent fparks, by whirlwinds driven, 
Stream'd thro' the fmoke, and fir'd the clouded heaven. 
As oft tall turrets funk with rumin£ found, 251 

Broad flames burft forth, and fweep the etherial round,

As thunders rumble down the dardcning vales, 
Roll'd thu deep l^Iernn voice of rufhing gales : 
The bands admiring gaz'd the wonderous fight, 
And Expectation trembled for the right. 260 

At once the founding clarion breath'd alarms ; 
Wide from the forest burft the flafa of arms ; 
Thick gleam'd the helms ; and o'er aftoniftVd fields,

From fhade to fhade the forms tremendous ftream, 
And their arms flam a momentary flame. 
Mid hollow tombs, as fleets an airy train, 
Loft in the fkies, or fading o'er the plain ; 310

Thro* twilight paths the maddening courfers bound, 

The fhrill fwords crack, the claming fhield6 refound. 

There, loll in grandeur might the eye behold 315 

The dark-red glimmerings of the fteel, and gold ; 

The chief; the Heed ; the nimbly-ruining car ; 

And all the horrors of the gloomy *ar. 

Here the thick clouds, with purple luftre bright, 319 

Spread o'er the long long holt and gradual funk in night ; 

Here half the world was wrapp'd in rolling fires. 

And dreadful vallies funk between the fpires. 

Swift ran black forms acrofs the livid flame, 

And oaks wav'd {lowly in the trembling beam : 

Loud rofe the mingled noife ; with hollow found, 325 

Deep-rolling whirlwinds roar, and thundering flames re- 

As drives a blast along the midnight heath, (found. 
Rufh'd raging Irad on the scenes of death ; 
High o'er his moulder gleam'd his brandim'd blade, 
And fcatter'd ruin round the twilight fhade. 3 jq 

Full on a giant hero's fweepiig car 
He ponr'd the tempest of reliess war ; 
His twinkling lance the heathen rais'd on high, 
And hurl'd it, fruitless, through the gloomy flcy ; 
JFrom the bold Youth the maddening courfers wheel, 335 
Cafh'd by the vengeance of his flaughtering fteel, 
5 Twixt two tail oaks the helpless chief they drew ; 
The fhrill car dafh'd ; the crack'd wheels rattling flew ; 
Crufh'd in his arms, to rife he flrove in vain, 
And lay unpitied on the dreary plain. 340 

Now Samlah's hands to war the chariot guide, 
Fair, beauteous, tall, fam'd Hamor's youngest pride ; 
O'er Achfaph's towers he flretch'd a potent fway, 
A n d faw furrounding realms his rod obey, 
Adnor, an elder birth, proud grandeur fpurn'd ; 345 

Lord of his foul, inferior realms he fcorn'd ; 
Nor felt one pang, nor fhew'd one envious frown, 
7/he;i doating Age to $amlah gave the crown.

Bound hit young fteps he caft a kind furvey, 
And taught the bleffings of an equal fway ; 330 

The pride of arts allur'd him to purfue ; 
To wifdom form'd him, and to virtue drew ; 
To reafon's rules his ftormy paflions wrought, 
And fhone, a pattern of the truths he taught. 

From Jabin's loins a matchless virgin fprung, 355 

And every voice with Salma's praifes rung. 
Her, Adnor led to mare his brother's throne, 
And made, delighted, Samlah's blifs his own. 
Five weeks the prince beheld in tranfport glide, 
Bless'd in the beauties of his lovely bride : 36© 

Heedless of war he dwelt, 'till Jabin's voice 
Rous'd him to arms, and call'd to ruder joys. 

Now, where bold had fcatter'd blood and fate, 
In the fame car the friendly brothers fate ; 
When Adnor thus— Oh fly yon mifcreant's arm ; 36^ 

Nor tempt the terrors of thefweeping ftorml

With a fierce look, th' impatient youth replies— 
Me doft thou urge to bafe, unmanly flight ? 
l*eap from the chariot ; hide in covering night ? 370 
Shall Salma hear ? mall Samlah's growing name 
Wade with the pangs of never-ending mame ? 
He faid, and furious, urg'd his rapid car, 
Cruih'dthe firm ranks, and fhouted to the war ; 
On Irad's courfe he drove ; the hero turn'd, 375

'Twixt the bold leaders pour'd an ardent band ; 
Sword clafh'd oa fword, and hand role up to hand j 
They fell ; new fquadronso'er their corfes rife. 
And louder tumults echo from the fkies. 38a 

Imperious Samlah lifts a haughty Cry- 
Hence, on your lives, prefuming daftards fly ! 
Who dares tranfgress fhall find a fudden doom : 
Cive Samlah place— -give kings, and heroes room—

Still crowd the war, and fwift to danger fpring ; 

Loud fung the vengeance of his pointed flecl, 

And a bold veteran, deeply wounded, fell ; 

Enrag'd, the bands on either fide retreat, 

And leave the furious monarch to his fate. 390 

Swift from the chariot faithful Adnor fprang ; 
On Jrad's fhield his ruining falchion rang : 
The Youth's quick wheeling, thro his moulder glides ; 
Drops the clest arm, and gufli the living tides. 
He funk ; and Irad, touch'd with pity, cried— 395 

Ah youth ! whofe bofom glows with generous pride, 
To scenes of endless gloom thy fpirit flies ; 
Wing, wing thy voice, for pardon, to the ikies ! 
Oh, Sire of all, may this brave warrior's mind. 
In life's fair climes, fome lowly maniion find ! 400 

He fpoke. The chief his anfwering mind address'd— 
If foft companion warm thy friendly brealt, 
Oh hear ! nor fpurn a dying brother's prayer ! 
Let Samlah's tender years thy pity mare ! 
Oh may a fire, a bride, thy bofom move ! 405 

The charms of beauty, and the calls of love ! 
Thus the kind youth, and fainting, as he cried, 
He liv'd for Samlah, and for Samlah died. 
So frown'd dread night on Abraham's fatal plain, 
When thou, Montgomery, pride of chiess, waft flain. 
Spare, fons of freedom ! fpare that generous tear ; 411 
To heaven resign, nor name the doom fevere-— 
Great, brave, and jult, to ward Columbia's fliame, 
He hunted toil, in fields of growing fame ; 
Alive, fair Victory ne'er forfook his fide ; 415 

He liv'd in triumph, and in glory died. 
Still bards mail fing, to earth's remotest clime,

And fcience charm'd him to her fweet abode; 

In vain fond parents hop'd his fteps again, 

And worth approv'd, and realms admir'd, in vain.' 

Yet patriot virtue writes the glory high, 425 

With foch a chief, in such a eaufe, to die. 

Soft fpoke the chief— O youth ! thy virtuous bloom 
Afk'd a lot milder, and a later tomb. 
Is there no biifsful feat, by Heaven a&gn'd 
To the fair efforts of a clouded mind ? 430 

To life well-acled, can no grace (apply 
A fweet remilfion, and a happy fky ? 
But thou, bafe coward, claim 'ft th' avenging iVord; 
Could'ft thou look on, and fee thy brother gor'd ? 
That befl of brothers, whofe concluding breath 435 

Restrains the falchion, and delays thy death ? 
Pale Samlah heard, and o'er t'h' embodied -wall 
He rulh'd, regardfess of his brother's fall, 
From rank to rank with panting breaft he flew, 
Where the war open'd, and the courfers drew ; 440

And lest at diflance far the pallid ray ; 
Ten thoufand fpears around him pierce the gloom ; 
Ten thoufand warriors rum to haftening doom ; 
Through the black ether Onoky volumes flow, 443 

And with brown light their fkirts all-umber'd glow ; 
Far o'er conflicting trains the flieets defcend ; 
The deep night thickens, and the fhades extend.

And crown'd with matchless itrength, retreat difdain'd ;

On all fides round, a thoufand twilight forms 

Invade the war, and ftrike their ringing arms ; 460 

Here, 'gainft the chief, prepar'd to pierce his foe, 

The lance unheeded aim'd the fatal blow ; 

There, whilft the warrior lilten'd to th T alarm, 

High o'er his helmet hung th' uplifted arm. 

Unnumber'd bucklers twinkle round the field, 46$ 

In light now dreadful, now in fhades conceal'd. 

Still more remote, involv'd in deeper gloom, 

Where hands unnotie'd dealt the frequent doom,

Fam'd in the contests of a thoufand plains. 47^

And vaft Madonians, wrapp'd in barbarous gold:

Whirl'd the fwift car, and drove their rapid way.

And promis'd triumph, ere the dawning ray. 50* 

High in his flame-bright car his fpear he rais'd ; 
A crimfon glory from his armour blaz'd ; 
Conquer, he cried, or fall, ye dauntless bands, 
The noblest heroes of a thoufand landf.

As fierce the fquadrons rufh to gloriocs war ; 
All droppM the javelin ; all the falchion wheel'd ; 51^ 
A copious (laughter drench'd the glimmering field ; 
From their dire arms a fearful fplencor came, 
And o'er their faces wav'd the gloomy "Same.

High o'er the rest his dreadful voice was heard ; 

High o'er the rest his lofty form appear'd ; 530 

His fhield, a crimfon moon, before himfpread, 

And o'er his vifage hovering horrors play'd ; 

His fteeds, like rapid winds, impatient flew ; 

His fword the firft, his fpear the diftant, flew ; 

Round the dark chariot countless weapons hung, 535 

And groans, with fullen murmur, ceafeless rung ; 

Rank after rank he turn'd to hated flight, 

And joyful Hazor throng'd the ftubborn fight. 
Before this dreadful path, two heroes fought, 

And warm'd with vengeance, countless wonders wrought. 

Sons of one fire, that in the defert fell, 541 

When impious Korah bade the hoft rebel. 

The helpless orphans generous Caleb bred, 

In arms inftruded, and to combat led. 

With mutual rlame their friendly bofoms lov'd ; 545 

|n peace together liv'd, in war together mov'd. 

Now, fide to fide, the manly heroes flood, 
And fable torrents from their falchions flow'd ; 
When Shammah thus---thou best of friends, behold 
Yon heathen's car, in gloomy terror roll'd. 55* 

How his fierce courfers wing their rapid way ! 
How his keen falchion cleaves the yielding prey ! 
Say, mall our force the mighty Chief defy, 
His arm experience, and his falchion try ? 
Or death, or triumph, (hall the deed await ; 555 

And what is death, in Israel's dubious fate ? 

To prove fierce danger for his maker's laws, 
And profTer life to fave his country's cause, 
Thou know'ft, brave chief, Seraiah quick replied — 
The good man's duty, ^nd the brave man's price. 56c 

He fpoke, and fiercely plunging thro' the war, 
Hew'd a wide path, and burft upon the car; 
Nor Shammah ftay'd. O 1 Jabtn's fpacious fhiel4

Thro' the thick orb the point no paffage found, 565 

Its (hade dark-quivering in the flamy round. 

With a fhgrt flalh, acrofs the thickening air 

The furious Heathen drove the greedy fpear ; 

Swift cm Seraiah's helmet funk the fteel ; 

His red arms rang ; the hero groan'd and fell. i 570 

With pangs, bold Sharnmah faw his brother's doom, 

And wheel'd his fiery falchion thro' the gloom ; 

From Jabin's hand a fecond javelin fped, 

Sung thro' his ear, and pierc'd his gufhing head ; 

Shrill rofe the conqueror's fhout ; and all around 57$ 

The plains remurmur, and the woods refound. 

Now, more remote from Ai's decreasing light, 
Slow moy'd a giant to the dreadful fight. 
As when dun fmoke, o'er all th* horizon fpread, 
Pours round the fetting moon a crimfon made, 580 

Diftain'd with blood, her broad, and dreadful eye 
Looks death, and ruin, from the Ihuddering fky : 
So gleams the circuit of his flame-bright fnield, 
And caftswide terror thro* the quaking field, 
A beam-like fpear commands his horrid way, 5S5 

And all, before him, fhun the dire affray. 

And now fierce Israel's fons, with fad furprize, 
To find brave Irad turn'd their boding eyes. 
Far round they gaz'd ; his form no more appear'd ; 
They liften'd ; but his voice no more was heard. 590 
Then every bcfom fudden fears appal ; 
Their nerves all fliffen, and their falchions fall ; 
A timorous fight their frozen hands fuftain, 
And fighs, and backward looks, confess their pain. 
With fhouts of triumph, fwifc the Heathens roll'd, 505 
And a bright terror flanYd from flamy gold ; 
A thoufand moony fhields before them barn'd ; 
Ranks fell at once, and troops to flight were turn'd; 
Each fatal ftep increa^'d the piles of flain, 
And boundless ruin ravag'd all the plain, 600 



■ 74- BOOK VII. 

As when a dorm in midnight pomp extends, 

And a broad deluge on the world defcends, 

From deep to fteep, difdaining every goal, 

SwelPcI with hoarfe thunders, mountain-torrents roll ; 

The vales all echo to the dreadful found ; 605 

The torne rocks roar ; the cracking trees refound. 

Meantime bold Irad far had crofs'd the fight, 
And Samlah vanifh'd with aufpicious flight ; 
Round the dread region gaz'd the Youth ferene, 
And eyed the grandeur of the folemn scene. 61 o 

Unnumber'd phantoms crowd the dufky war ; 
The half-feen hero, and unfiniuYd car : 
Black were the (hades, as midnight in the tomb, 
And floating glimmerings fpread a fearful gloom. 
Now roll'd the diftaditories an awful found ; 61 5 

Mow nearer clamors fhook th' embattled groim,d. 
At once, from western £elds, a fhout afcends ; 
The plains all tremble, and the concave rends : 
Quick turn'd the chief, while fad alarms infpire, 
And faw dark forms, that pafs'd along the fire ; 620 

Slow tow'rd the camp the fhouting fquadrons move, 
And long pale fpires tremendous wave above. 

Ah wretch ! he cried— to childifn heat a prey ! 
How foon wild paflion drove my fteps aitray ! 
What chief, less vain, fhall lay th' increafiog fear ? 625 
Who cheer the bands, my piefence ought to cheer ? 
Ah ! fhould difgrace, and dire defeat, enfue, 
No more this guilty face fhall Jofliua view ; 
Thefe eyes ne'er open on a holt undone, 
Eut death, or glory, by this arm be won. 630 

Thus as he fpoke, he crofs'd the deep array ; 
To his known form they yield an eafy way : 
Red flafh his arms ; and hi^h above the Held, 
Gleams the drear luftre of his orbed fhield. 
So, pale, and dreadful, thro' the midnight made, 6^5 
"Sails a broad meteor o'er the mountain's head :

Dim rife the cliffs ;_ and on the kindling air, 

Stream the long terrors of its fanguine hair. 

His voice refounding thro* the gloomy fight, 

Reviv'd their ftrength, and turn'd th' increasing flight. • 

Fly, daflards, fly ; defert your Maker's laws ; 641 

Your name difhonor ; yield your country's cause; 

But come, ye friends of Israel's injur d name, 

Sons of the fkies, and heirs of deathless fame ! 

Know, round the diftant plains, by chiess infpir'd, 645 

By virtue prompted, and by vengeance ftr'd, 

Bold, manly warriors, never taught to yield. 

Cleave their fell foes, and fweep the dufty field ; 

Let this bright pattern every breaft inflame; 

Here lift yourfwords, where Irad leads to fame. 650 

Thus every rank his voice invites to arms ; 
His prefence actuates ; his example charms ; 
From band to band, with nimble courfe, he flies, 
Wheels the long holt, and wakes intenfer cries ; 
I'hick flam the falchions ; thick the javelins rain ; 655 
And mooting banners tremble o'er the plain ; 
In every fee ne, alert, the youih appears ; 
Each chief, each rank, his cry with tranfporc hears ; 
Shouts fiercely burfting liftening earth appall, 
And hovering Conquest yet fufpends her fall. 66% 

And now bold Irad, thro' the thickest war,. 
Drove the tall chief, and darkly rolling car, 
When, lo ! the giant full before him flood, 
Involv'd in death, and cover'd o'er with blood : 
Like fome vaft wave, approach'd the horrid form, 665 
Heedless of fpears, aud raptur'd with the florm. 
His wonderous fize th' admiring Youth beheld, 
And fnatch'd a lance that glitter'd on the field ; 
Loud rang the weapon on the monger's brow ; 
Backward he quick recoil'd, and bending low, 6?Q 

Stood daggering. Jrad wav'd his dreadful fword, 
Springing impetuous; fwift between them pour'd

And fierce around thern thoufand heroes toil'd :

Now loud, and folemn, thro' the rearing vales

With deep confufion (hook the cliff's tali brow, 
And rufh'd tempestuous on the world below ; 6gc 

From grove to grove the blast impatient flies,

On Ai's broad flames, with wild dominion, falls, 
And pours ten thoufand thunders round her walls. 
More wide", more bright, the folding fires afcend, 685 
Heave the dunfmcke, and far in ether bend ; 
The glittering brands, by rapid whirlwinds driven, 
Stream, like dim meteors, o'er the blacken'd heaven ; 
Swift through the woods red paths expanding roll j 
Long heavy volumes thicken round the pole ; 690 

From all the concave fparks in torrents rain, 
And fiery tempefls rufk along the plain. 

Far through the groves the furious flames had fpread, 
And thoufand fires rofe fcatter'd in the made, 
Ere Hazor's bands (fo eager rag'd the fight) 695 

JBehcld, wiih fad amaze, the fearful fight. 
Then Jabin's voice, terrific, bade retire, 
And the glaJ warriors fled the widening fire.

Tue CONQUEST of CANAAN, 
BOOK YllL 



O'ER mifty hills the day-ftar led the morn, 
And flreaming light in heaven began to burn; 
Wide scenes of woe the boundless blaze difplay'd, 
Where the fleel triumph'd, and the deluge fpread. 
On wafted plains unnumber'd corfes lay, j 

And fmokes far fcatter'd elimb'd upon the day, 
Still clouded flames o'er eaftern mountains rife, 
And Ai's broad ruins fadden all the fkies. 

When lo ! in glimmering arms, and black array, 
Like ftorms low-hovering in th' etheriatl way, 10 

Far round the north a gloomy cloud afcends, 
Irs horror deepens, and its breadth extends. 
Compact and firm, as mov'd by one great foul, 
A front immenfe, the widening fquadrom roll ; 
Thick moot the fpears ; the trembling helmets beam, 
And waving bucklers call a moony gleam. 16 

As the dire comet, fwift through ether driven, 
In folemn filence climbs the western heaven ; 
His fanguine hair, portending fearful wars, 
Streams down the midnight fey, and blots the fiars ; 20 
Pale death and terror light the d-jfky gloom, 
And quivering nations read their fudden doom,

So In the flaming van great Jofhuarofe, 

And fhot red glories on the wondeiing foes. 

At his command the trumpet founded high, 2 - 

Aerial ensigns dancing in the iky ; 

Near and more near, they trac'd a dreadful way, 

Join'd Irad's hofc, and Mretcn'd in long array. 

From Hazor's ranks that now before the wood, 
In three embattled fquares, refulgent flood, 30 

Great jobab flroce. In Madon's realms he reign'd : 
Red was his eye, his brow with blood diftain'd ; 
A beam his fpear ; his vafr, expanded fhield 
Shot a bright morning o'er the crimfon field ; 
His head fublime a mighty helmet crown'd ; 3 - 

His quivering plumes with fable horror frown'd ; 
Six cubits from the earth, he rais'd his frame; 
His with was battle, and his lire was fame. 

Proud was his father ; prouder was the fon : 39 

Nought mov'd his pride ; the tear, nor piercing groan : 
UnmatchM his force, he claim'd a match Jess fame, 
And every combat deckM his brightening name. 
Princes, his captiv'd fiaves, before him bow'd, 
Stalk'd in his train, and round his chrriot rode ; 
While their fair partners, ftrfl in triumph led, 45 

Held the rich cup, or grac'd the brutal bed. 
Oft had furronnding realms his aid recuir'd, 
Ere Zimri's hand Ai's hapless turrets fir'd ; 
But Hill their prayers, and flill their gifts were vain, 
Till Jofhua's glory rous'd his fierce difdain. ^o 

Elfe had no proffer mov'd his haughty mir.d,

When the joint wifhes of the various band 
To nobler Jabin gave the firft command.

y Twas he, wlien Irad rais'd his dreadful voice, 

And inmost Hazor trembled at the soife, 6® 

When prudent Jabin urg'd a nightly florm, 

Ere the Youth's voice the {lumbering camp Ihould arm : 

Bade his vafl fquadrons in the wood delay, 

Nor lift a fpear, till morn fhould lead the day. 

Shall this brave hofl th' unmanly path purfue, 65 

■Fight ambufh'd foes, ana bafely creep from view ? 

Shall Jobab, like the thief, to conqneil ileal, 

And bravery call, what coward minds can feel ? 

And now, from Jabin the proud chief demands, 
To lead, as iirfl in place, the central bands. 7« 

He, coolly wife; rehVns the fhadowy name, 
And, pleas'd with fubflance, boails a nobler fame 

Forth from the hoil, in ileely pomp, he ftrode, 
And 'twixt th* embattled lines fublrmely flood. 
His towering fxride, vafl height, and awful arms 75 

Chill'd all his foes, and fcatter'd wide alarms : 
When thus the chief— Ye fonsof Israel know 
The dauntless challenge of no common foe. 
If in your hofl three heroes can be found, 
(Be Jofhuaone] to tempt this dangerous ground* B« 

Here mall they learn what llrength informs the brave, 
And find no God can mieldthem from the grave. 

Stung with the infult caft upon his God, 
To the great Leader Irad nimbly flrode, 
And thus— Shall yonder heathen's haughty cry 8$ 

Dare Israel's hofl, and Israel's God defy ? 
Let me this boafcer whelm in inflant fhame, 
Avenge my nation's cause, my Maker's name. 

Exalted Youth! the fmiling Chief replied,

Nor heed the mockery of yon heathen's rage. 
This hand, though young, ihall boait a conquering day ; 
Blind is wild rage, and pride an eafy prey. 
Here too (hall Jolhua's potent prayers be given, 
And the bless'd aid, that Virtue hopes from Heaven. 100

The Youth ftaik'd fearless o'er the horrid field ; 130 

The hoft, with rapture, view'd his lofty ftride, 
The leap alert, the port of conscious pride; 
But each grave chief, by long experience wife, 
With faltering accent, to his comrade cries —

What bravery can, fair Irad will perform, 
But can the opening floweret meet the (lorm ?

Now near the scene bold Irad urg'd his courfe, 
Where Jobab triumph'd in refiftless force ; 
When the huge warrior, fwell'd with angry pride, 14^ 
With bended brow, and voice contemptuous, cried-- - 
Art thou the champion of thy vaunting race ? 
Shall this poor viclory Jobab's falchion grace ? 
Go, call great Jofhua, long to war inui 'd,

Retire, ere vengeance on thy helmet light ; 
Fly to yon troop, and fave thy life by flight. 

His haughty foe the Youth undaunted heard ; 155 

Vain, empty threats his bofom never fear'd ; 
O'er the vaft form he turn'd his fmiling eyes, 
And faw unmov'd the livid vengeance rife* 
Then, with a rpfv blufh of conscious worth, 
Calm from his tongue his manly voice broke forth-— 160

At random trembled on the couriers' manes ; 

Behind he gaz'd, and found no path to fly ; 275

He rum'd refiftless on the thickefl war, 
From Jabin's lance a grateful exit found, 
Sunk in his arms, and ftifren'd on the ground. 

Far from the fight, despoiFd of helm and (hield,

Deaf to the groans, and careiess of the cries ; 
His hair foft-whiitiing o'er his half-ihut eyes.

When Jofhua ftrode the heathen hoft to dare, 525 

To guard the camp was prudent Caleb's care. 
He, coolly wife, had furamon'd all the train, 
Difpos'd in ranks, and guided o'er the plain, 
All arm'd for war, at diftance meet to flay, 
And wait the changes of the dreadful day. 530 

In even fcale while dubious combat hung, 
And far in fouthern fields the tumult rung, 
Silent, they liften'd to the blended cry, 
And heard faint fhouts in diftant murmurs die. 

But now th' approaching clarion's dreadful found 53$ 
Denounces flight, and makes the bannerM ground ; 
From clouded plains increafing thunders rife, 
And drifted volumes roll along the fkies. 
At once the chief commands ; th' unnumber'd throng. 
Like gathering tcmpests, darkly pour'd along : 54c 

High on the winds, unfurPd in purple pride, 
Th' imperial iiandard caft the view afide ; 
A hero there fublimely feem'd to ftand, 
To point the conqueit, and the flight command ; 
In arms ofburnim'd gold the warrior fhone, 545 

And wav'd and brighten'd in the falling fun. 

Swift tow'rd the fight approach'd th' impatient throng, 
And wider pour'd the thickening duft along ; 
Loud, and more loud, victorious clamours grow, 
And, more diiVinguifh'd, breathe the founds of woe ; 550 
Pale Judah's fons a yielding fight maintain, 
And many a face looks backward o'er the plain, 
When Caleb's mighty voice, in thunder driven, 
Starts all the holt, and rends the clouded heaven. 
What dismal scenes, enrag'd the hero cries— 555 

Convulfe this heart, and pierce thefe bleeding eyes ! 
Shall Judah's race, my brethren and my boaft, 
Plee, vanquifli'd, driven, before a heathen holt? 
Can men, can warriors own fo black apart, 
The bell of chiess, your Jofnua to defert i 560

Say with what pangs will Heaven the wretches try, 

That know no honour, and that feel no tie ? 

On yon bright plain, the conquering Chief behold, 

Troops wing'd before him, cars tumultuous roll'd, 

With Heaven's imperial fword the fight commandr, 565 

And drives fierce ruin o'er decreafing bands ! 

Say, mall the Man, who rights, who bleeds for all, 

See your bafe flight, and perim in your fall ? 

The Chief, as angels kind, as angels true, 

Sink in the doom, he warded long from you ? 57° 

Fly then ; but know, a few fhort furlongs part, 

Von camp wild flames, and favage fwords mall wafte ; 

Befmear'd with flreaming blood, your parents lie, 

And, dauYd on (tones, your gafping infants die ; 

Your wives, betray'd by such bafe culprits, feel 575 

Abufe, more dreadful than the griding fteel ? 

No arm, no fword the falling nation fave, 

But this dire evening ope our common grave. 

Can thefe dread scenes even daftards fail to arm ? 579 

Spring from the trance, and burft, the fleepy charm ; 

Rife, rife like men ; with ihame, with vengeance burn ; 

Wipe foul difgrace, and fwift to fight return. 

And ye brave chiess, that never knew to yield, 

Or turn a backward foot from glory's field, 

But, led by me, the van's bright honours claim, 585 

Smile at fair death, and (brink from torturing fhame ; 

Lift high th* avenging fword, from pity free, 

And cleave the wretch that bafely dares to flee. 

He fpoke : the found their manly bofoms fir'd, 
Wheel'd their long ranks, and every arm infpir'd ; 590 
Even cowards now to generous combat arm'd, 
And fainting heroes with new vengeance warm'd : 
Fierce Hazor's fons with equal fury driven, 
Like one wide cloud, that fhades the fkirts of even, 
Rufti'ddark and dreadful : ranks, by ranks impell'd, 595 
Felt the keen lance, and heap'd the flreaming field.

So thick the fquadrons wedg'd their black array : 
Loud tumults roar, the clouded heavens rewound, 
And deep convulfions heave the labouring ground.

Hedg'd his dire path with heaps of ghaflly flain ; 6c6 

Back roll'd the fquadrons ; death's encircling ihade

On the far camp they turn'd a frequent view ; 6i - 

Their fainting falchions fcarce the right renew : 
Throng'd in a blackening ftorm, the foe deicends ; 
Swift drive the chariots ; far the duft extends. 
With fmiles, bold heathens hail commencing flight ; 
Their lances fhower ; their eye-balls rlaih delight. $2«

Nor knew the cause, 'till Trad till'd the air;

Pal'd the blank face, and froze the faltering voice.

Let danger Heel you, and let irad few,

When, vving'd by blatfs, red conflagrations rife, 
Blaze in the cloud-capp'd towers, and fcorch the fides. 
Black drifts of duft fmcke through the vafl profound ;

The fvift-wing'd flame, defcending, kindles heaven, 
Scath'd by the dreadful flream, the huge pines fall, 
And burtb'ng glory wraps the fmoking ball ; 
O'erthe tall mountains rolls the voice of God, 6rj 

The plains all tremble, and the forests nod : 
So fwift, fo bright, the rufning hero pour'd ; 
With every ftroke his fword a life devour'd ; 
Full on hi: foes he bore refiftless dorm, 
Pale fquadrons opening to his angry form ; 65© 

His fhield blaz'd horror, and his lofty hand 
Fell, with fwift ruin, on the lestening band;

Rulh'd rapid Zimri through the parting hoft ; 

Mark'd by his eye the haplefr foe was loft ; 

O'er quivering ranks his fword incestant hung ; 675 

Loud in their ears his voice funereal rung

Now while the Kittites fled the dire alarm, 
Their haughty king withftood th* invading arm. 680 
Shrill rofe the thunders of his piercing cry, 
Loft in deaf ears, and echoing through the fey ; 
With fwifter fteps, his warriors urg'd their flight, 
And dark behind them rufh'd purfuing night. 
Fierce on the king's bright car, with rapid force, 6S5 
Refiftless Zimri drove his dreadful courfe ; 
The dauntless monarch caft his mighty fpear,

Full on brave Zimri's helm the polifh'd fteel 
Clafh'd harmless, and to earth, rebounding, fell. 690 

Regardless of the fhock, the nimble chief 
Sprang to the car ; no fword could lend relief; 
Caught by his arm., the heathen beat the ground ; 
Wide on his bofom funk the fatal wound ; 
The greedy blade, deep-plunging, gafh'd his fide, 69; 
And down his buckler pour'd a bubbling tide. 

Wing'd with fierce ardour, Zimri mounts the car, 
And calls his heroes to the crimfon war — 
Rufa on to conquest, every generous band, 
Lo the Mess'd triumphs of this happy hand ! 700

And gloomy fadness brooded o'er the ground. 
All pale, and folemn, rofe the languid moon, 
And fried a feeble twilight from her throne. 
Sad in her tent, the feeling maiden fate, * 

Fed on her woes, and figh'd her hapless fate. 
Diflblv'd in tears, her tender parents came, 
To mare her grief, and iUy life's parting flame. 
Like dull, cold lightr, that hover o'er the tomb, 
A lone lamp languifh'd round the filent room : 10 

Befide her couch, two lorn attendants ftay'd, 
And drooping, lingering, eyed th* unco lfcious maid. 
O'er the fad scene the pair attentive hung ; 
*Tiien round the favourite form all-anxious clung : 
Her tearless eye-balls fcarce the virgin turn'd, j$ 

But, iix'd in blank despair, her flumbering Trad mourn'd. 

Awake ! oh wake ! the tender mother cry'd— 
My child ! my darling i nature's ioveliest pride ! 
Awake, and hear ! oh hear thy mother's call ! 
Behold thefe- tears for thee in anguilh fall ! 20

Why mould he ope the wound he could not heal ? 

As thus their bofoms waii'd his hapless end, 
And mourn'd, as each had loft his chofen friend : 
Admir'd why Heaven had made such worth in vain, 325 
And why connVd it to the dreadful plain ; 
His generous deeds in deep difpair ran o'er, 
And faw him live, and fpeak, and a<5r, no more ;

Near the rough mafs, in folemn thought, reclin'd, 

Thus fad reflexions fill'd his pondering mind.

What mighty toils, to gain immortal fame ! 

What wattes, what /laughters, build the darling name ! • 

Yet this rude tomb, this (hapeless pile, contains, 

Of chiess, of kings, the pear, the fole remains. 

This prize to win, muft nations then expire ? 355 

And feats of peace, and joy, be whelm'd in fire ? 

Oh Heaven, in pity, loofe the ties, that bind 

To man's black race, a juft and honest mind ! 

Low funk the fun. As now the chief return'd 
From midft the camp, and hapless Israel mourn'd* 36a

Proitrate he fell, and reverent kiiVd the ground. - 
Uprah'd by Jofhua's hand, again he Rood, * 

And thus his fear in plaintive accents flow'd. 
Hail mighty prince ! to thee alone tis given, 365 

To tafte the favour of indulgent Heaven ; 
To guide, with profperous hand, the race hechofe, * 

And hurl destru&ion on refilling foes. 
Thou know'ft, with thee how Gibeon'sfons are join'd;

And millions haite t' atchieve the barbarous deed.

The quivering form me press'd, in icy death,

No more her careless thoughts attempt to fly ; 

No more her ear attends the horrid cry : 

Clofe to ttit wound her fnowy hand applied 

Withdrew the lance, and itoppM the purple tide. 

A grim barbarian to the fair-one came, 4*£ 

Pierc'd her white fide, and forc'd the vital ftreani ; 

With one weak gafp, on Elands bofom laid, 

Her bloom all vanifh'd, and her fpirit fled. 

In diils nt fields, we heard the trumpet's founds 
And ilrode impatient to the fatal ground. 430 

On the fadfeene^ by favouring fhrubs conceal'd, 
A youth, unarm'd, the dire event beheld : 
He, drown'd in tears, difclos'd the fierce affray, 
And fnew'd where Mina, and her Elam, layl 
On the cold earth, the wither 'd leaves he press'd 5 435 
The fair yet panting at his lifeless bread.

So blooms a flower befide th* autumnal ftrearh, 
And waves, and wantons, in the folar beam, 44--> 

Nor knows the froit, that in the midnight (ky 
Lurks for its charms, and bias its beauty die.

To the fame grave oar friendly hands convey'd. 
Kind youths, and tiTgins, there at dawn appear, 445 
Strew fragrant flowers, and drop the tender tear ; 
There the fad wijfl rofe yields its withering bloom. 
And melancholy muiic mourns their doom. 
Pierc'd thro* his thigh, and weltering on the ground, 
A favage wretch , beneath an oak, we found, 45© 

By favours won, he fhew'd th' impending doom,

Now Night, in vestments rob'd, of cloudy die, 

With fable grandeur cloth'd the orient fky, 

impell'd the fun, obfequious to her reign, 

Down the far mountains to the western main ; JCp 

With magic hand, becalm'd the folemn even, 

And drew day's curtain from thespangled heaven. 

At once the planets fail'd around the throne ; 

At once ten thoufand worlds in fplendor ihone :

Turn'd his flow fteps, and view'd the fplemlid scene ;

The half-feen world, and all the pomp of Heaven, 
Wide arch'd the palace of th' Almighty hand,

Now mournful murmurs (lowly-pen five rife ;

Whither, O whither is thy beauty gone ? 535 

To what far region ? to what world unknown r 
No lone, drear (hades of everlafling gloom, 
Verg'd on the confines of the icy tomb, 
No frozen climes, extend impervious bounds, 
Confine thy walks, and bar thy active rounds, 54- 

Forbid thy upward flight at large to rove, 
And climb the mountains of eternal love. 

Far other scenes thy lovely fpirit claim ; 
Far other manfions own thy lading fame. 
Borne on light wings, I fee thy guardian com', 545 

Unchain thy mind, and point the flarry home : 
With joy, he clafps thee in immortal arms, 
Waves his young plumes, and (miles ethcrial charms; 
Through fields of air, he wins his purple way, 
And rofy choirs, delighted, round him play. 550

How, loos'd from (lumbers by the morning ray, 561 

O'er balmy plains we bent our frequent way ?

Slid, unperceiv'd to scenes of happy love. 
'Till weak, and loft, the faltering converfe fell, 
And eyes difclos'd what eyes alone could tell ; 
In rapturous tumult bade the paflions roll,

Sweet as the Heep of Innocence, the day, 
By raptures number'd, lightly danc'd away ;

And each, too happy ! afk'd no brighter heaven. 
Yet then, even then, my trembling thoughts would rove,

And Ciui a mournful glance on ills to come.

And wav'd their fplendors to the burfling day. 20

How two brave patriarchs, in one friendly gloom,

If, when dread war refounds her hoarfe alarm, 
Health flufh the cheek, and vigor brace the arm, 
To fight, the warrior virtue fame command, 
And knaves alone refufe the needed hand. 
But tho'J, brave Hanniel, feek'f: the field in v

£.ich on his brethren gaz'd with glad furprize, 

And the great fcul flood kindling in their eves. 

From northern gates her dark battalions pour'd, 355 
And many a Lero fierce to combat tower'd ;

The white locks trembling o'er his ancient head. 
Hail, mighty Chief !— -the hoary prince began--- 
Favourite of God, and virtuous friend of man 1 -5(1;

To feeble age, and folitary grief.

With death familiar, and with scenes cf blend. 
But now fad age my head baa w-hiten'd o'er ; 
This palHed arm mml wield theiwerd no more. 
To mourn, to weep is all my future doom, 
Drawn neat to death, and bending o'er the tomb. 
Thefe bands thy voice obey , in dinger's ueld 
Their manly bofoms Dever knew to yield : 
Nor will their feet, long tried in honour's race. 
Now learn to flee, and nrft commence difgrsce. 
But, fix'd to death, their king, their land to (ave, 
All force will hazard, and a-11 terrors brave. 

When round the hofi [ turn my weeping eye?, 37* 

And gaze, and gaze, my foul, with anguifh, cries 
Where, where is Eiam : Oh, may no fad doom 
Compel thee to a fen's untimely tomb'! 
A happierlife, a brighter lot be thine ; 
Tafte all the rapturing joys that once were mine. 3 So 
Fronxchildiess age may Heaven his chofen fave, 
Nor bring thy hoary hairs in forrow to the grave ! 

Great prince ! the Chief, with cheering voice., replied- 
Thy nation's father, and thy countr-'s pride ! 



i%l BOOK XI. 

Not (mgly thou the pangs of grief haft known ; 3S3 

I mourn a daughter, as thou weep'ft a Con. 

From hearts too fond, Heaven call'd the pair away 

To fields of blifs, and climes of lading day. 

May every virtue in thybreaft refine, 

Till thofe fair climes, and all that blifs be thine. 39* 

But now retire, where yon bright chariot Hands ; 
Let youth and vigour lead thy warlike bands, 
For fee, to fight Canaan's millions rife ! 
And hark, what clamors rend the boundless ikies ! 

The king obey'd. In arms, the ardent throng, 395 
Behind Almiran, darkly ruiVd along ; 
Almiran, Gibeon's noblest, bravest fbn, 
Led the bold heroes, and like lightning fhorve. 

In three vail fqnadrons flood the heathens ilrength, 
And rofe a mighty front of dreadful length. 400 

O'er northern banks, where chariots hoarfely rung, 
Like clouds of thunder, haughty Hebron hung : 
There too fierce Eglon ruiVd with dreadful roar, 
Like the long murmurs of the ftjunding ihore. 
Nor feebler legions fill the fouthern plain ; 41 5 

There Lachifh, Jarmuth there, the fight fuftain ; 
To the dire centre numerous nations throng, 
And Jabtn guides the ftorm, and fwiftly flames along. 

With, piercing eyes the Chief his foes deicried, 
And bade his hoft in three vail fquarcs divide. 410 

'Gainft Lachifh Gibeon rolls in proud arra\ ; 
'Gainft Hebron Afher bends a dreadful way : 
As fires puri'ue a comet's fanguine form, 
Behind great Jofhua drives the central fiorm. 

Now o'er the plain, as ccean pours his tide, 415 

Their llreaming ensign* rear'd in purple pride, 
Far north, and fouthward fbetch'd the chefen train, 
AnJ croib'd in gloomy pomp the creadfu) plain. 
Near, and more near, th' undaunted warriors drew ; 
For well the Chief, by fure exfcriei.ee knew 420 



BOOK XI. 2S5 

That nations, taught in fudden fight to rife, 

To war by Health, and triumph by furprife, 

To wiles, vain- glorious, fall an eafy prey, 

r r-d, throng'd in tumult wild, arefwept away. 

Thence, near the foe he bade the fquadrons move, 42; 

Tempt with keen taunts, and with proud threatnings prove, 

That chiess, and men, with childifh rage o'ercome, 

Might quit the more, and hade to certain doom. 

Now near the ftream the facred thoufands flood, 
Their breafts all panting for the scenes of blood. 430 

At once, as fome black dorm begins to rife, 
A cloud of arrows fill'd the weltern fkies ; 
The long, afcending gloom all heaven o'erfpread, 
And the fields darken'd with a tranfient fnade. 
Then flones on (tones tempestuous ether pour'd : 435 

And darts on darts in quick fucceffion fhower'dc 
Now here, now there, expiring warriors fell, 
And fhrill beneath them rung the clafhing fteel. 

At once, as mov'd by fear, the Chief withdrew, 
And bade his hoft the diftant walls purfue. 44® 

With joy, the heathens eyed their backward way, 
Rais'd a long fhout, and fprang to feize the prey. 
Swift rum'd th' exulting thoufands down the more; 
For ranks behind, urg'd on the ranks before ; 
Loud ring the chariot?, fwift the courfers bound, 445 

And a deep thunder waves along the ground. 

Around, great Jabin cart a mournful view, 
Andfaw his foes retreat, his friends purfue, 
Kis laws contemn'd, that bade the thoufands (lay, 
Till o'er the torrent Israel urg'd their way ; 45 O 

Kenn'd the deep fnare, by Jolhua wifely laid, 

And tohimself with fighs thus fiercely faid 

I fee, proud chief, I fee thy profperous wiles ; 

On me fate frowns ; on thee propitious frailes ; 

But not alone I prove the general doom ; 455 

Ten thoufand gholls mall meet me at the tomb : 



ptf BOOK XI. 

Aveng'd, and happy to the (hades I'll go, 
To bid thy princes quake in realms below. 
Thus fpoke the king, and deem'd his ruin nigh, 
A fearful vengeance reddening in his eye ; 
Strong, fell despair in P. am' J his eager look ; 
,His bands gaz'd trembling, and his princes {hook. 

Meantime with fmiles the facred Chief beheld 
Kis foes nilh headlong o'er th' embattled field ; 
A: once his piercing voice restrain'd the flight, 46^ 

W^eelM his long ranks, and marihall'd to the fight. 
At once the trump's tremendous blait afcends 
The plains all ihudcer, and the concave rends ; 
Loud as the flornVs ten thoufand thunders rife, 
A fhoutunmeafurM rocks the lands and Ikies ; 
Jlgain high heaven is gloom'd with ftony fhowers ; 
Again all ether darts unnumber'd pours ; 
With deep convulfion roars theclofmg war ; 
Fierce bounds the fteed ; fonorous rolls the car ; 
With one broad ruin heaves the earth amain, 4-^ 

And Night, and Death, and Horror, fhroud the plain. 
So pours a. florm on Greenland's frozen fhore ; 
The hoarfe winds rage ; the maddening billows roar ; 
When bpundiess darkness wraps the realms on high, 
And flaming meteors ft.- earn acrofs the fky : 480 

Huge ifies of raging ice, together driven, 
With buriting thunder rend air, fea, ar.d heaven : 
Rocks rife o'er rocks ; o'er mountains mountains roH, 
And the world trembles to the diflant pole. 
Thus o'er the field the dreadful tumult grows ; 4S5 

Alike impetuous, foes encounter foes ; 
Where Aftier's fons proud Hebrow's hod engage ; 
Or where bold Gibcon pours her torrent r-», 
Or where, around the Chief, immingled rif; 
Triumphant clamours, and expiring cries. 4^D 

Long roar'd the tumult of the dubious right, 
And nobufc coward wiih'd inglorious flight :

Flung'd his freed fpirit to the nether world ; 
Far round the field a fhout of joy afcends, 
And groans re-murmur from his fadden'd friends. 

Then fvvift the Hero wheel 'd his flaming fword ; 
Like mountain ftreams his hoft behind him pour'd ; 5 13 
Loudroar'd the thunders of the dreadful plain, 
Ilock'd the tall groves, and flll'd th' etherial main : 

Increasing horror rent the world around, 

And ileeds,and cars, and warriors mingled on the groyne. 
Now near the ilream approach'd the founding war, 51 5 

When fierce to combat roll'd a fplendid car ; 

There giant Zedeck rofe in dreadful view ; 

Two furious fteeds the mighty monarch drew ; 

With wild impetuous rage, they foam'd along, 

And, pale before them, fled the parting throng. 5^ 

From Jofhua's courfe he faw his bands retire ; 

His reddening afpedl flafh'd a gloomy fire ; 

With huge, hoarfe voice the furious hero cried, 

"While the plain? rriurmur'd, and the groves replied,

To turn they tried, with fhort and fudden wheel ; 555

And flreamy lightnings round him fiercely burn'd. 

At once all Afher furious rufh'd to fight, 855 

Each ardent warrior fpurn'd inglorious flight. 

With wider ruin lieave the trembling fields ; 

Cars burfl; cries roar ; groans murmur ; found the fhields, 

As in fomeforest two red flames afpire, 

And whelm huge pines in Roods of furging fire, 8co> 

Then fwift through falling groves together driven 

Roll o'er the mountain tops, and kindle heaven : 

So, fierce and dreadful, front to front oppos'd, 

Mid clouds of duft, the thundering fcuadrons clos'd : 864 

Earth (hakes ; air rends ; the trembling ikies refound, 

And night, and fad dismay, invade th' embattled ground. 

For war undaunted Hebron fiercely burn'd, 
Nor even in Jofhua's path to flight were turn'd. 
Full on his fword they ruth'd, and bravely fell ; 
New bands with trafcfport fac'dthe ilaughtering ftcel. 
Incestant cries o'er all the combat rung ; 871 

Incestant fpears tnrough darken'd ether fung ; 
Swift flew the courfer ; fwift the raging car ; 
Hoarfe rofe the tumult of the maddening war : 
Less loud through forests winds impetuous roll, 875 

The huge pines fink, and temped rends the pole : 
Less loud 'gainft Zembla mountain billows roar, 
When the ftorm thunders on the Frozen more.

And jofhua's deeds the fons of IfracI nr'd. ggo 

Now where the Chief terrific fwept the field, 
And, cloth'd in terror, ranks on ranks repell'd ; 
Whilft a red deluge o'er his footfteps fpread, 
And countless torrents fpouted from the dead ; 
Swift to his path a chief of Afher ran, £$5 

Wild with dismay, and quivering thus began--- 
Wing, wing, thou belt of men, thy friendly p«ah— 
Oh fare the hero, or avenge his death!-—

Now Zimrl dies ; from yon afcending ground, 

I favv fierce Jabin point the fatal wound--- 893 

He fpoke ; at once, from all the Heathen train, 

A voice of thunder heav'd th' affrighted plain: 

Loud as hoarfe whirlwinds torrent flames infpire, 

When up the mountains rolls tempeltuous fire ; 

Loud as th' Almighty's voice, through ether driven, 895. 

Pales the wide world, and makes the walls of heaven ; 

Long fhouts tremendous from the fields arife, 

Burn" o'er the hofts, and rend the clouded ikies. 

Through Israel's thoufands thrills a dire alarm, 

When thus great J'ofhua nerves each fainting arm-— 9CO' 

Urge, my brave warriors, urge the glorious Arife ; 

"Wheel your red fwords, and J'ave the leader's life — 

Shall Zimri die, whilft each aflonifh'ditands, 

Nor fees thefe falchions ufeless in our hands ? 

Alive the fainting hero meets my fight, 905 

And yet maintains the folitary fight---* 

He fpoke, and furious wheel'd his dreadful fword ; 
Back rolFd the heathens ; ftreams of daughter pour'd : 
Behind him Alhcr's holt in deep array 
Throng'd darkening; clouds and death involv'd their way ; 
The bounding fleeds bedew'd their hoofs in blood, 91 1 
And chiess and monarchs fwell'd the purple flood. 

Now, where bold Zimri brav'd the deathful ground, 
O'erhung with foes, and pierc'd with many a wound, 
Whilft labouring, panting, heav'd his frequent breath, 
And o'er his helmet flafiVd defcending death ; 916 

Great Jofliua, flaming, drove th* embattled train ; 
Their lances flew, their falchions rag'd in vain. 
])ire as a peal of thunder fweeps the ikies, 
He rufli'J. and D< ath (ate frowning in his eyes : 929 

For now brave Zimri fcarce fuilain'd the ilrife; 
Sunk on one knee, and wifh'd to fell his life. 
Thro' the thick tumults of the broken war 
Jrrpcuious Jabiri wing'd his rapid car -,

With ruddy beams his lance uplifted (hone ; .925 

Mis waving buckler mock'd the fanguinefun; 
'Twixt the bold chiess, undaunted at the ftorra, 
Sublime great Jofhua rear'd his mighty form. 

Now front to front the frowning heroes flood ; 
Their eyes red flames ; their faces dropp'd with blood 5930 
Their fwords the lightning; two broad moDns,their Giields 
Shot a fierce glory through the dreadful fields. 
Then Jabin's heart, though form'd of ftubborn flee], 
Firit (hook with terror, and firft learn'd to feel. 
But rous'd by keen difdain, and vengeful ire, 93.5 

Quick from his eye-balls biaz'd infernal iire ; 
To earth, impatient, from the car hesprang ; 
His bread beat high ; his rattling armour rang ; 
To die refolv'd, but as a king to die, 
Like fudden thunder rofe his burning cry— 940 

From this right hand receive, thou bafe-born Have, 
A death too noble, but 2. daftard's grave ; 
Torne by the dogs, thy carcafe here mall lie, 
Or glut the fowls, that fweep th' avenging fky. 
The Chief difdain'd return/ The Heathen's (leel .945 
Full on his helm with rapid fury fell, 
Glanc'd by his fword, it clave the bloody ground ; 
Eife had the Eiero known no future wound. 
Then withfwift wheel, through Jabin's yielding (ide 
Rulh'd his keen blade, and pour'd the fable tide; 950 

Aghaft, their monarch's fall his hest beheld, 
And fullen groans rung murmuring round the field. 

Like Heaven's dread thunder Jofliua rais'd his voice ; 
Kafh backward roll'd ; earth trembled at the noife-—

Amaz'd, Canaan's realms the pomp defcried ; 

The world grew pale ; the hearts of nations died : 

The bounding Hero feiz'd the mining car, 

Snatch'd the long rein?, and Ihouted to the war : 

Behind, fierce Afher r.vLft to vengeance flew ; 9^* 

All dropp'd their fpears, and all their falchions drew j 

A fudden blaze gleam'd round the dufty gloom, 

Andplung'd ten thoufand warriors to the tomb. 

For now, o'er all the fight, the heathens yield, 

And Israel triumphs round the dreadful field. tyj 

High in the van, fublime great Jomua rode, 

Wing'd the dire flight, and fwell'd the tide of blood ; 

Aghafl, they fee the lightning of his eyes, 

And hear the thunders of his voice arife. 

The plains are tumult all, convuls'd affright, 975 

Fierce ruin, wild amaze, and raging flight ; 

The Chariots ftream ; the Heeds all eager bound, 

Stretch o'er the plains, and fweep the rifing ground ; 

O'er rocks, o'er floods the thoufands headlong fly, 

And fwords, and fpears, and Ihields, behind them lie ; 

No flop, nor backward look, nor likening ear, 9? 2 

From plains to forefls pants the full career ; 

Behind, the Hero wings his rapid way, 

And duft and darkness ihroud the beams of day. 

So, borne in clouds of fire, an Angel's form 9S5 

On impious Sodom drove the dreadful ftorm. 

From heaven, in dreadful pomp, the Viuon came ; 

Far, far behind him, flream'd the angry flame ; 

The dark-red thunder, from his right hand hurl'd, 

Upheav'd the fky, and fiVd the rocking world ; 990 

High o'er the dorm, on wings of light, he rode, 

And fail'd, in lucid triumph, to th' approving God. 

Long runVd the vigors o'er the fanguine held, 
And fcarce were Gibeon's lofticft fpires beheld ; 
When up the welt dark clouds began to rile, 99J

A ridge of folding fire their fummits (hone ; 
But fearful blackness all beneath was thrown. 
Swift round the fun the fpreading gloom was hurl'd, 
And night, and folitude, amaz'd the world. 10©# 

At once the voice of deep-refounding gales 
Rung flow, and folemn, in the diflant vales ; 
Then through the groves, and o'er th' extended plain, 
With ftormy rage the rapid whirlwinds ran : 
Red o'er the glimmering hills, with pomp divine, 1005 
The lightning's flaming path began tofhine; 
Far round th' immenfe unufuai thunders driven. 
Proclaim'*! theonfet of approaching Heaven ; 
AftonilVd Nature own'd the ftrange alarm, 
And the world trembled at th' impendent fiorm. 1019 
O'er the dark fields aghaft Canaan ftream'd ; 
Thick in their courfe the fcatter'd bucklers gleam'd : 
Behind them, Jofhua urg'd the furious car, 
And tenfold horrors hover'd round the war. 

But when the Chief the fpreading ftorm furveyM, 1015 
And trae'd almighty arms in heaven difplay'd ; 
With piercing voice, he gave the great command— 
Stand ftill, ye chofen fons, admiring ftand 1 
Behold, what awful scenes in heaven arife ! 
Adore the power that brightens in the fkies ! X0 2G 

Now God's tremendous arm alTerts his laws ; 
Now bids his thunder aid the righteous cause ; 
Unfolds how Virtue faves her chofen bft^ds, 
And points the vengeance doom'd for guilty lands. 1024 
Behold, what flames fhoot forth ! what gloom afcends ! 
How nature trembles ! how the concave rends ! 
Kow the clouds darken ! fee, in yonder &y,

Thron'd on a dark red cloud, an Angel's form. 

SaiPd awfully fublime, above the ftorrn. 

Half veil'd in mihV his countenance, like a fun, 1035 

fnftam'd the clouds, and through all ether (hone ; 

Long robes of. crimfon light behind him flow'd ; 

His wings were flames ; his locks were died in blood ; 

Te«i thftufand fiery fhapes were round him driven, 

And all the dazzling pomp of opening heaven. 104c 

. Now, fave Canaan's cries, that feebly rung, 

Round the dark plain a horrid filence hung. 

Stretch'd in dire terror o'er her quivering band, 

Th'etherial Vifion wav'd his fun-bright hand ; 

At once from opening fkies red flames were hurl'd, 104; 

\And thunders, roll'd on thunders, rock'd the world, 

In one broad deluge funk th f avenging hail, 

And, fill'd with tempest, roar'd the hoary vale ; 

The headlong whirlwinds boundless nature blend ; 

The ftreams rufh backward ; tottering mountains bend ; 

Bow» the tall fteep their burfiingfummics roll, 105 l 

And cliffs on cliffs, hoarfe-crafhing, rend the pole ; 

Far round the earth a wild drear horror reigns ; 

The high heavens heave, and fink the gloomy plains: 

One fea of lightnings all the region fills : lc SS 

'Long waves of fire ride furging o'er the hills ; 

The nodding forefls plunge in flame around, 

And with huge caverns gapes the fhuddering ground. 

Swifter than rapid winds Caniian driven, 

Refufe the conflict of embattled Heaven. 1060 

But the dire hail in vain the viclims fly, 

And death unbounded fhook from all the fk.y ; 

The thunder's dark career ; the Seraph's arm, 

Fierce vengeance blazing down th' immenfe of rtorm. 

From falling groves to burning plains they flew ; icCz 

Hail roars around, and angry blalh purfuc ; 

From making heavens almighty arms are hurl'd. 

And all tfie gloomy concave bur/Is upon the world,

,No dry like this the guilty earth had known ; 
ftot Egypt's {lorm with equal terror fhone ; 10JO 

No day like this o'er eallern hills (hall rife, 
Till Gabriel's trump irrrolls the finking fkies. 
For Heaven's dread ilores, referv'd for death, and war, 
Fierce hail, and lightning, fill'd the rending air. 
In vain the holt attempted ftill to fly ; IC75 

They fell, they rofe again ; but rofe to die. 
Mid thoufand corfes, there, beneath his Ihield, 
Stalk'd a lone trembler through the founding field : 
Here, fcatter'd wretches roani'd along the plain, 
And flickering bucklers hid their heads in vain. 100Q 
On every fide reiiftlefa foes engag'd ; 
The lightning's livid blail around them rag'd ; 
While the lhrill torrenti of th' avenging hail 
Ruth'd on the pinions of the fweeping gale. 
Rare, and more rare, were {sen the finking hoft, io8£ 
3 Till, whelm'd beneath the deluge, all were loft. 

Thus, when black midnight's terrors earth deform, 
From the tall Andes burfts a blazing florm ; 
From fteep to deep the ridgy flames afpire, 
Bend o'er wide realms, and wrap the heavens in fire ; 109* 
All nature trembles ; tottering mountains rend ; 
Down the cliff's thunder ; mowers of fire defcend ; 
Huge hills of ice, diiTolv'd, and wades of fnow 
Plunge in one deluge on the world below ; 
O'er half Peru the floods tempeituous fweep, 1095 

And rocks, and groves, and towns, roll mingled to the deep. 
The form began to move ; the clouds gave way, 
Their ikirts all brightening with the crimfon ray ; 
Far fouth, on wings of fire, the Angel flew, 
And his clear fplendors lestening lest the view, nom 

Down the broad regions of the mid-day ikies, 
Where glittering domes werefeen, and fcarcely feen to rife, 

Through the long day, Canaan's widows flood, 
And look'd, all-anxious, toward the plain of blood j

Enrich'd with fpoils, and with fair fame renown'd. 
The : r hands, to glad their friends with choice repaft,

Oft as adufty cloud the whirlwinds rear'd, 
In diftant fields they thought their lords appear'd ; 1 1 io 
Then, with new terrors, gaz'd, and gaz'd again, 
'Till night, and forrow darken 'd every plain. 

The itorm retir'd ; the ensigns gave command, 
And round their Leader throng'd the conquering band. 
Here fparkling eyes with joy and triumph burn'd ; 1 1 15 
Here pity fitent from the daughter turn'd ; 
Here for fallen friends the tear was feen to fiow,
