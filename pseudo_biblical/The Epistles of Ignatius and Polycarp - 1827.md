PREFACE.

In recommeDdiDg the following little work 
to the perusal of the Christian reader, for be 
it £rom me to encourage the notioD^ that 
much IndiscrimiDate reading of theological 
writings tendeth to make good Christians: 
for the greatest part, even of those honored 
by the appellation of Fathers of the Church, 
frequently run very wide of the mark of 
TRUTH, and are adapted more to bewilder 
than to edify. This remark will be found 
applicable, with even greater force, to the 
writings of modern divines, especially the 
numerous company of the present day, who 
are indeed destitute of all soundness. 

The more I read, the more 1 see and feel 
cause to admire, and adhere to that watch- 
word, as it may be termed, of the reformers, 
tIz. : ' that the bible is the only legitimate 
fitaadard for the proving of orthodoxy and

heresy.* As it is written — < To the law and 
to the tesiifMmy : if they speak not according 
to this wordy it is because there is no light in 
them: (Isa. viH. 20.) 

And viewing the infimte number of ^ wolves 
in sheep's clothing/ who, in this our day, lie 
in wait at every tuming, to entrap the simple^ 
I am exceedingly anxious that those repeated 
divine cautions should be deeply impressed 
on the minds of all who value their immortal 
86als9 viz. : ^ Beware , of mend (Matt, sb 17«X 
^Beware of false prophetm? -(Matfc* viL 16«)^ 
^ Take heed, therefbrep-^haw ye< hearJ r^Lmik^ 
viiL 1&) ^ Belovedj believe Mtietrisirgfrjiflm^ 
but try the spirits, whether tkiey are of God z 
because many false propheiS'mre gene j^ut\intsk 
the world: (I Johniv. 1^ &eJ &c4^i - * 'm! . 

Yet still it must be confessed that there 
are choice portions of divibity scattered there 
and there, through the wide space of >.jabout 
eighteen hundred years^ which can stareely 
be read without edification ^jof these the 
choicest that I have met with^ * is the epistles 
of Ignatius. - «•• 

On my first meeting with these ^^istles, 
feeling their exeelldncy^ and the admirable 
spirit in which they are oomposed^^I feltafeo 
surprised that they should be so littiie known 
among us; and upcm ttiat uadertoioky Ood' 




sparing me, to provide a new version of them, 
with the view, not only of gratifying those 
friends, who, I well know, will be truly 
gratified, but also that others likewise may 
read, and see (if it shall please God) what 
manner of people his chosen people are. 

They are seven in number, which were all 
written after their author's condemnation to 
the wild beasts. Five of them may be called 
letters of thanks to the churches, from which 
he had received kindnesses, on his way from 
Antioch to Rome. The vigilant servant of 
Christ takes occasion therein to address 
eEU*Dest exhortations of perseverance to the 
saints* explaining at the same time some 
important points of the Christian faith ; and, 
above all, solemnly warniog them to beware 
of the too zealous and industrious heretics 
of the times. The letter to his friend Poly- 
carp is of a somewhat different character, as 
it contains exhortations and instructions to 
that great bishop himself, respecting the vast 
importance of his office, and the right manner 
of fulfilling its duties. The letter to the 
Romans is truly beautiful, and widelydifferent 
frorti all the rest, and may be called a letter 
of entreaty ; wherein he earnestly beseeches 
ttoern to use no means whatever for the 
reversal Of the sentence passed upon him by

the emperor, but rather to encourage him to 
meet his approaching trial like a faithful and 
valiant soldier of Christ. 

The heretics were of that kind called 
Docetse, which signifies seemerg. They held 
that the Almighty Redeemer had only the 
appearance of a man, and consequently that, 
when he was crucificid, he did not really 
suffer, but merely seemed to suffer: hence 
the name, seemers. 

These epistles, excellent as they are, as fiir 
as I know, have been only once translated 
into our language, viz., by Archbishop Wake, 
about a century back. The volume of the 
learned archbishop contains several other 
writings, together with a large mass of pre- 
liminary matter, amounting in the whole to 
four hundred and seventy-four pages. The 
bulk of such a volume, independent of any 
other cause, is a great impedlmeot to its cir- 
culation among that class of my fellow- 
creatures, for whom this translation is more 
particularly designed. 

The epistles of Ignatius are introduced by 
one of Polycarp, Bishop of the Smymseans, 
who was the first that collected them together, 
in order to be transmitted to the church at 
Philippi, according to their request. Polyearp 
is, upon strong grounds, believed to have been 



presiding over the Smyrniean church at the 
time that the apostle John addressed to it 
that letter contained ia the Revelation. The 
two letters with which the book is concluded, 
exhibit to us the last trials of these two 
eminent primitive Christian bishops and 
martyrs. 

All that history has handed down concern- 
ing their lives, Is contained in the following 
testimonies of the ancients, which are taken 
from the valuable edition of the most learned 
Archbishop Usher. 

I have deemed it necessarry to add in an 
appendix a few explanatory notes and obser- 
vations; such as the present inauspicious and 
superstitious times seemed to me to call for, 
and also to discuss somewhat more at lar^e 
one or two passages of scripture, on which 
prevailing errors have been grounded. 

After the work was, as I thought, finished, 
a second appendix also became necessary, by 
the recent issuing frona the press of a pam- 
phlet of a very heretical character, and which 
required to be noticed in the strongest terms 
of reprobation. Many, no doubt, would like 
the book better without either of these 
appendages: but those whose opinion is 
alone worth any regard with me, will not be 
b 



of that nnniber : they will be thankful for 
them both. 

Be it remembered, that by the publication 
0f these most ancient, and also, on that 
account, most interesting letters, I have no 
view of establishing any one point of faith ; 
for the bible is the true standard for that 
purpose : so far from it, that if I thought 
there was a single expression in them at 
variance with the Word of God, they should 
not be published by me. 

All disquisition with regard to their 
genuineness I purposely avoid, not wishing 
to waste the time of my reader ; but for his 
satisfaction shall present him with two short 
extracts from two writers of very good 
repute ; while for fiirther information on that 
bead, I refer the more curious and inquisitive 
reader to the incomparable Usher, or to the 
later work of Archbishop Wake. 

*' But to prove the genuineness of that 
epistle (to the Romans) and of the other six, 
which are every where received, would be a 
vain thing* after the diligent researches of 
so many very learned men, even without the 
pate of the Roman church, by whose industry

apostles and prqphets wba weiit befeve them j 
and ever has been the {iractiee of every ^mut 
of God' from tibat day to this. Bfut ibo siieh 
thing as burning of heretics, or taking away 
their lives by other means, or offering any 
kind of violent resistance to them, was ever 
iitlempted by the primitive Christians. In 
fact they had the command of their Master 
to wholly abstain from sudh conduct : ^ Put 
up again thy sword into his place : for all they 
that take the sword shall perish with the 
sword.' (Mat. xxvL 52.) This command 



ijbey boM in mind^ and more than that, they 
paid obedimce to it.

in a eomitnfr, and at a time, where and when 
liberty of cimseienee is granted to the utmost 
that can possibly be denredy there is no 
OxeiMe for even a diseontented thought on 
that sobjeei. Brevity being my aim, I shall 
not longw here detain the reader; only 
adding, that if he reaps but half the pleasure 
in the perusal, that I have reaped in the 
translating of the following work, my labour 
will meet a more than sufficient recompence.

Ignatius, finmoos nntfl now in mosl pincfi, obtaioed bj 
lot the bishopric, aeoood in soooessioo after Fder, at Aatiocfa. 
History informs ns that this sMa ^las sent from S3rria to 
the city of the Romans, and became the food of wild beasts, 
because of his testimony for Christ. And as be made bia 
journey through Asia, with a most careful watch of guards* 
confirming the BGJoamers in every city, whither hej omu e y ed* 
by verbal fiscdnrses aiad forewandngs, he exhdHed dieai 
above all, to beware of the heresies, even then first springing 
up and appearing ; and cautioned tfiem to hold &st what was 
delivered by the apostles, whidi for security he now also* 
forcibly bearing testimony, thought it utuMStji lo coanoit 
to writing. 

In this manner at length, having arrived at Smyrna, iHiere 
was Polycarp, he writes one epistle to tiie drarch at Ephesos, 
making mention of its shepherd Onesimus ; and another to 
that at Magnesia, on the Maeander, where again he made 
mention of Damas, the Inshop ; and moreover another to 
that at Tralles, the ruler of which at that time;, he rdates, 
wias Polybius. In addition to these, he writes also to the 
church of the Romans, to which he proffisrs also an exhor- 
tation, that they would not, by petitioning against his martyr- 
dom, deprive him of his longed-for hope. 

CHAPTBB XXXVI. 

And these things he wrote from the fore-mentioned city to 
the churches enumerated. But now being gone beyond 
Smyrna, he converses again by letter firom Troas, both with 
them at Philadelphia, and with the ehurch of the Smjrmseans, 
and privately with Polycarp, its president ; whom well know- 
ing to be an apostolic man, he, as a genuine and good shep- 
herd, commends to him his flock at Antioch, counting him 
worthy to have the care of it, on account of his diligence.

the time of Ahicetus, and they had conferred a little together

concerning some other affairs, they were quickly at peace, 
not being fond of contention between themselves about this 
principal matter : for neither could Anicetus persuade 
Polycarp not to observe, what he had always observed with 
John, the disciple of our Lord, and with the other apostles 
with whom he had been acquainted ; nor, on the other hand, 
did Polycarp persuade Anicetus to observe tbem, who said, 
that he ought to hold to the custom of the elders before him. 
And matters being thus circumstanced, they held communion 
together ', and in the church Anicetus yielded the administra- 
tion- of the eucharist to Polycarp, from pure esteem /or him^ 
and they parted in peace, the whole church, both of those 
who observed, and of those who did not observe, (the 
eastern custom), enjoying peace, f

nmrtyrdom), Polycarp always taoght these things, which he 
learned even from the apostles, and whidi hef ddivered to 
the church, and which only are true. 

All the churches in Asia, and the successors t9i this day in 
the chair of Polycarp, testify that he was a mudi more 
creditable and more steadfiitft witness of the truth than 
ValenUnus and Marcion,and the other evil-minded penom. 

He also in the days of Anicetus made a journey to Rome, 

and turned many back from the fore-mentioned heretics to 

the church of God, by preaching that he had received this 

nme and only truth from the apostles, whidif he also deli« 

^ered to the church.

And there are those who have heard him declare that Johd> 
the disciple of the Lord^ going to bathe at Ephesus^ and 
perceiving Cerinthus within^ sprung out of the Bath, un- 
bathed, and with this speech—''' Let us flee, lest even the 
bath should fall upon us, Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, 
being within.'* And moreover, when Marcion once met 
Polycarp himself, and said to him, ' Acknowledge us,' he 
answered, ''I acknowledge thee the flrst-bom of Satan.** 
So great a fear had the apostles and their disciples, that they 
would hot even in discourse hold communion with any one of 
those that adulterated the truth : as also Paul said, '' A mati 
that is a heretic after the first and second admonition, reject : 
knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being 
condemned of himself."* 

There is moreover an epistle of Polycarp, written to the 
Philippians, very profitable, out of which those who are 
desirous, and who are minding their own salvation, may learn 
both the impression of his faith, and the preaching of the 
truth.

by the church of the Smymseans, which had Polycarp ap-

In these times too, was eminent in Asia, Polycarp, the com-^

of the church at Smyrna, by the eye-witnesses and attend-

whether by the eastern or irestern charch, to support their saperatitions doctrine of 
in&lllble tradition. I have therefore adhered to ths old and tme reading. Innumer-

Polycarp^ the disciple of John the Apostle^ and ordained 
by him Bishop of Smyrna^ waschief of all Asia -, inasmuch as 
he had for his masters, and saw, some of the apostles, and 
of those who had seen the Lord. This man, by reason of 
certain questions concerning Easter-day, came to Rome, 
tmder the Emperor Antoninus Pius, when Anicetus ruled the 
church in the city; where he brought again to the faith 
numbers of believers, that had been deceived, by the persua- 
sion of Marcion and Valentinus. And when Marcion had by 
accident met him, and said : " Acknowledge ns 3** he an- 
swered : ''I acknowledge thee the first-born of the devil." 
And afterwards in the reign of M. Antoninus and L. Aurdius 
Commodus, in the fourth persecution after Nero, he was 
delivered to the fire at Smyrna, the Pro-consul and all the 
people sitting in the Amphitheatre, and crying out against 
him. He wrote to the Philippians a very useful Epistle^ 
which even to this day is read in the assembly of Asia. 

OfLDAS, IN HIS REPROOF OF THE CLERGY OF BRITAIN. 

Who among you is, as the shepherd of the Smymaean 
church, the excellent Polycarp, the witness of Christ, who 
humanely set a table for the guests, that eagerly dragged 
him to the fire 3 and when cast to the flames for the love of 
Christ, said : ''He who hath granted to me to bear the punish- 
ment of fire, will grant unto me to endure steadfastly the 
flames without being fastened with nails/'

An Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians was read, full of 
much admonitioo, with perspicuity and simplicity^ according 
to the ecclesiastic character of interpretation. And he alsa 
says^ that he had sent unto them the Epistles of Ignatius 
Theophorus, and begs to be informed by them in return^ if 
they had heard any thing of him. 



THE BISHOP. 



Will you be ready, with all faithful diligence, to banish and 
drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines, contrary to 
God's word ; and to use both public and private monitions 
and exhortations, as well to the sick as to the whole, within 
your cures, as need shall require, and occasion shall be given ? 

Answer. I will, the Lord being my helper.

PHILIPPIANS 



For our conversation is in heaven ^ from whence also we look 

for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ ; who shall change 

our vile body, that it may be fashioned Uke unto his glorious 

body, according to the working whereby he is able to subdue 

all things unto himself — Phil. iii. 20^ 21.

dhurch of God, which sojoumeth at Philippi ; 
mercy and peace from God Almighty, and 
the Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour, be multi- 
plied unto you. 

I rejoiced greatly in our Lord Jesus^Christ 
with you, who received the patterns of true 
love, and helped on their way, as it behoved 
you, those that were infolded in bonds befit-

ting saints, which are the diadems of those^ 
who have been truly chosen of Grod and our 
Lord ; and that the strong root of your faith, 
declared of old times, remaineth until now,^ 
and bringeth forth fruit unto our Lord Jesus 
Christ, who for our sips en^uar^^ eyen to 
undergo death; whom God raised, having 
loosed the pains of death ; in whom, though 
ye have not seen him, ye believe, and bdiev- 
ing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and fiill

desire to enter^) )(now)qg tl¥M^ by grace ye 
have been saved, not by reason of works, 
but by the will of God, through Jesus Christ.

Ire loved $ ^bbstaiiiiiig ftofm aU injustice, gree- 
^ihefsd, lbt6 of tbotiey, evil-speaking, felse- 
Witiiessifig ; n6t tendering evil for evil, or 
railing for railing, or striking for striking, or 
cursing for cursing. But caU to mind what 
l3ie Lord said, when teaching: ^ Judge not, 
l^dt ye be not Judged % forgive, and it 6hall 
bc^ forgiveltt unto you; shew mercy, that 
toercy may be shewn unto you 5 by whalt

yoti again. And, that blessed are the poor, 
li'tfd thefy who are persecuted for righteons- 
He^" i^ake, foebi^tiise thdr^ is thie kingdom of 
XSbd.' 

III. These thiings, brethren, I have not 
td^ken upon mysc^lf to wrfte unto you conceal- 
ing righteousness ; but, because ye first caHed 
upon me. For neither I, nor any other like 
unto me, is able to foUoiw after tSie wisdom 
of the blessed and glorious Paul, who being 
personally present among such of you, as 
were then living, taught diligently and firmly 
the word of truth. Who also, when he was 
absent, wrote epistles unto you, 'to which if 
ye give heed, ye will 'be ena^bled to be built 
on the faith, which has been given unto you, 
which is the mother of you all, hope follow- 
ing close upon, love leading the way, love to 




God and Christ, and to our neighbour. For 
if any one of these be within, it hath fulfilled 
the eomDiandment of righteousness ; for he 
that hath love, is far trom all sin. 

IV. But the love of money is the begin- 
ning of all calamities. Knoiving then, that 
we brought nothing into the world, and cer- 
tainly are not able to carry any thing out, let 
us arm ourselves with the armour of righte- 
ousness; and let us teach first ourselves, to 
walk to the commandment of the Lord ; and 
afterwards your wive* to walk in the faith 
that has been given unto them, and in love 
and chastity; (being naturally affectionate 
to their own husbands in perfect truth, and 
loving all alike in perfect continence) and to 
instruct their children in the instruction of 
the fear of God. Let the widows he prudent 
concerning the faith of the Lord, interceding 
without ceasing for all, being far from all 
calumny, evil-speaking, false-witnessing, love 
of money, and every evil; knowing that they 
are attars of God ; and that all our concern.? 
are seen, and that nothing is hid from him, 
neither reasonings, nor thoughts, nor any 
of the secrets of the heart. 



V. Knowing therefore that God is not 



J 



I 



TO THE PHILIPPIANS. IJ 

mocked, we ought to walk in a manner 
worthy of bis commandment and glory. In 
like tnaoner let the deacons be blameless 
before his righteousness, as servants of God 
in Christ, and not of men ; not devils, not 
double-tongued, not fond of money, conti- 
nent in all things, compassionate, diligent, 
walking according to the truth of the Lord, 
who became servant of all ; whom if we shall 
well please in the present world, we shall 
receive also that, which is to come, as he 
promised us, to raise us from the dead : and 
that if we shall conduct ourselves in a man- 
ner worthy of him, we shall also reign with 
him, if we do indeed believe. In like man- 
ner also, let the young men be blameless in 
all things, above all providing for chastity, 
and restraining themselves from every eviL 
For it is good to be raised up from the lusts 
that are in the world ; for every lust warreth 
against the spirit. And neither fornicators, 
nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves 
with mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of 
God. Wherefore, it is necessary that they 
abstain from all these, being subjected to the 
elders and deacons, as to God and Christ. 
Let the vii^ins walk in a blameless and pure 
conscience.

POLTCARP 



VL And let the elders also be tender^ 
hearted, compassionate towards all, convert- 
ipg those, which have been led astray, taking 
the oversight of all the infirm ; not negleet- 
ing widows^ or the orphan, or the poor : bat 
providing always that which is good before 
God and men, alistaining from all wrath, 
respect of persons, unjust judgment ; being 
fiur from the least love of money; not be^ 
lieving hastily against any one; not severe 
in judgment ; knowing that we are all debtcm 
of sin* If, therefore, we beseech the Lord^ 
that he may foi^ve us, we ought also to 
forg^ive* For we are before the eyes of the 
Lord and of God, and we must all stand 
before the tribunal of Christ, and each ^ve 
an account for himself. We should there- 
fore so serve him with fear, and entire devo- 
tion, as himself commanded ; and the apostles, 
who preached the gospel unto us; and the 
prophets, who before proclaimed the commg 
of our Lord ; being zealous for that which 
is good, abstaining fi"om offences, and from 
the false brethren, and from them, who bear 
the name of the Lord in hypocrisy, who lead 
fistray empty men. 

VIT. For every one, who confesseth not 



TO THE PHILIPPIANS. 10 

that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is 
Antichrist :^ and whosoever confesseth not 
the testimony of the cross, is of the devil. 
And whosoever perverteth the oracles of the 
Lord to his own lusts, and says that there is 
neither resurrection, nor judgment, this man 
is the first-born of Satan. Wherefore hav- 
ing forsaken the vanity of the multitude, and 
their false doctrines, let us turn to the word 
delivered unto us from the beginning, being 
vigilant with prayers, and continuing instant 
In fastings ; beseeching the All-seeing God 
with supplications, not to lead us into tempr 
tation, as the Lord said : ^^ the spirit is indeed 
wiUing, b.t fte aesh is we.*.- 

YIIT. Let us therefore continue without 
intermission in our hope, and the earnest 
of our righteousness, which is Christ Jesus, 
^ who bore our sins in his own body on the 
tree ; who did no sin, nor was guile found m 
his mouth ;' but he endured all things for us, 
that we might live in him. Let us therefore 
be imitators of his patience ; and if we suIKsf 
for his name, we glorify him ; for by himis^lf 
he set us this pattern ; and far this we he^ 
lieved. 

JX. I therefore exhort every one of you ti|. 



I 



pi POLYCARP 

obey the word of righteousness,^ and to ex- 
ercise perfect patience, which ye have seen 
before your eyes, not only in the blessed 
Ignatius, and Zosimus and Rufus; but also 
in others of your own people, and in Paul 
himself, and the rest of the apostles ; having 
been persuaded that all these did not run in 
vain; but in faith and righteousness; and 
that they are in the place due unto them, 
with the Lord, with whom also they suffered. 
For they loved not this present world ; hut 
him, who died for us, and of God rose again 
on our account. 

X. Stand^ therefore in these things, and 
follow the example of the Lord ; firm in the 
faith and immutable, fond of the brother- 
hood, loving one another, united in the truth, 
shewing meekness one to another, despising 
none. When ye have the power of doing 
good, defer it not: because mercy delivers 
from death. Be ye all subject one to ano- 
ther ; having your conversation irreproach- 
able among the Gentiles ; that by your good 
works both ye may receive commendation, 
and the Jjord in you may not be blasphemed. 
But v/oe unto him, by whom the name of the 
Lord is blasphemed. Therefore teach all 
sobriety ; in which be ye also fashioned. 



TO THE PHILIPPIANS. 21 

XI. I have been exceedingly grieved for 
Valens, who was made presbyter among you 
sometime ago; that he is so ignorant of the 
station which was given unto him. I ad- 
monish you, therefore, to abstain from covet- 
ousnees, and to be chaste and true of speeoh, 
AbstiuQ from all evil. Whosoevei- is unable 
to govern himself in these things, how can he 
charge another? If any one has not kept 
himself from covetousness, he will be polluted 
with idolatry; and will be judged as if Ae 
were among the Gentiles. But who are igno- 
rant of the judgment of the Lord ? Know 
we not, that the saints shall judge the world ? 
as Paul teaches. But no such thing have I 
perceived among you> or heard of> among 
whom the blessed Paul laboured ; who are in 
an especial manner his epistles : for^ of you 
he boasts in all the churches* which alone 
then had known God : for we had not yet 
known him. 1 am, therefore, brethren, sadly 
grieved for him, and for his wife : to whom 
may the Lord give true penitence. Be, ye, 
therefore, sober in this, and do not esteem 
such as enemies, but recal them as frail and 
erring members, that your whole body may 
be safe : for, by so doing, ye build up yo^- 
selves. , , 



» 



XII. For I am confideDt that you have been 
well exercised in the holy scriptures, and 
nothing is hid from you : but to loe it has not 
lately been granted : as it is written in these 
scriptures : — * Be ye angrtfi and sin not ;' and 
' Let not the sun go down on your wrath' 
Blessed is he who remembers : which I believe 
to be in you. Moreover, may God and the 
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the 
eternal High-priest himself, the Son of God, 
Jesus Christ, build you up in faith and truth, 
and in perfect meekness ; and ivithout wrath, 
and in patience, and long-sufiering, and en- 
durance, and chastity ; and give you a lot 
and part among his saints, and unto us, to- 
gether with you, and to all who are under 
heaven, who shall believe in our Lord Jesus 
Christ, and in his Father, who raised him 
ag^n from the dead. Pray for all the saints. 
Pray also for kings, and powers, and princes, 
and for them that persecute and hate you, and 
for the enemies of the cross ; that your fruit 
may be manifest in all things ; that you may 
be perfect in him. 

XIII. BoUi yon nnd Ignatius wrote to nie, 
that if any one should go into Syria, he should 
carry the letters from you <ilso : which I will 



I 




TO THB PH1LIPPIAN8. 23 

doy if I find a coDvenient opportunity, either 
If or one^ whom I shall send to discharge a 
mission also for you. The epistles of Igna- 
tius, which were sent unto us by him, and 
what others we had Mth us, we have sent 
unto you, as you charged us ; which are sub- 
joined to this fepistle, from which you will be 
able to be greatly comforted : for they con- 
tain faith and patience^ and all edification 
that pertaineth unto our Lord. And concern- 
ing Ignatius himself, and those who are with, 
him, signify what information you have 
received. 

XrV. This I have written unto you by 
Oreseens, whom in the present epistle I have 
Commended unto you, and now commend: 
for he has had his conversation among us 
without blame; and I believe also in like 
manner among you. Moreover, ypu shall 
have his sister commended, when she shall 
come unto you. Be ye safe in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, in his grace, with all yours. Amen. .

which was fore-ordained before the worlds to

will of the Father and of Jesus Christ, our 
God ;-— I have had proof of your well-beloved

name in God, which ye have possessed by a 
righteous birth, according to faith and love in 
Jesus Christ our Saviour: being followers of 
God, having liindled into new life in the blood 
of God, you have well performed a work 
agreeing therewith ; inasmuch as ye had 
heard of me, bound from Syria, for the com- 
mon name and hope, hoping by your prayer 
to attain in Rome to fight with wild beasts, 
that through martyrdom I may he enabled to 
attain to be a disciple of him, who for us 
offered himself to God, an offering and a 
sacrifice. For I have received your whole 
multitude in the name of God in Ooesimus, 
whose love is not to be told, and your bishop 
in the body;^ whom I beseech you to love 
according to Jesus Christ, and to be every 
one of you in his likeness. For, blessed is he 
who hath freely given unto you, being wor- 
thy to possess such a bishop. 

II, And concerning my fellow - servant 
Iturrhus, pertaining to God your deacon, 
blessed in all things, I pray him to remain^ 
for the honor of you and of the bishop : and 
also Crocus, worthy of God and of you, whom 
I have received as a pattern of the love 
which is from you, hath refreshed me in all 
things ; so also will the Father of ' Jesus 



96 I6HAT1US 

Clirirt refresh him, together widi OnemaaSf 
and Burriiiis, and Eiqdns, and Fronto, by 
whom, as pertaining to lave^ I have seen yoa 
alL May I have joy of yoa always, i^ 
however, I be worthy. It is then beeoming 
ih ev^ry way to glorify Jesos Clirist, who 
hath glorified you ; that b^ng made compile 
In one subordination, beii^ subjected to the 
bishop, and to the presbytery, you may in all 
things be sanctified. 

UL I do not charge yoa, as being any po^ 
son : for^ althoogh I am boond in his name, I 
have not yet been perfected in Jesas Christ : 
for, now I begin to be a disciple ; and I speak 
with yoa as with my fellow-disciples : for, I 
oaght to have bemi anointed by y<m with 
fidth, admonition, patience, long-soiFerhig. 
Bat since love does not saffer me to be silent 
concerning yoa, for this caose I have been 
beforehand in exhorting yoa to ran m agree- 
ment with the will of God. For, also Jesas 
CSirist, oar andoabted life, is the will of the 
Father, as also the bishops, who have been 
ordained to the ends of the worlds are in the 
will of Jesas 



IV. Whence it is fit that yoa shoald ran in 
agreement with the will of the bishop, 



TO THE BPHBSIANS. SS 

ako ye do. For, your honourable presbjrtery 
has been so fitted to the bishop, as strings to 
a harp. Therefore, by your unanimity and 
symphonious love, Jesus Christ is sung. 
And be ye dlso individually a chorus, that 
being symphonious in unanimity, having rch 
ceived the tinge of God by unity, you may 
sing with one voice, throiugh Jesus Christ, to 
the Father ; that he al^o may hear you, and 
may acknowledge, by your well-^oiug, that 
you are members of his son. Therefore, it is 
profitable: for you to be in blameless unity, 
that also you may always be partakers of God. 

V. For, if I in a little time have had such iur 
timacy with your bishop, (not that pertaining 
to. man, but spiritual), how much more, do I 
count you happy,^ who have been so suspended 
ifpon Atm, as the church upon Jesus Christ, 
and Jesus Christ upon the Father, that all 
things by unity may be symphonious ? Let 
no man be deceived; if any one be not within 
the altar,^ he lacketh the bread of God. Foe, 
if the prayer of one and of a second hath such 
great force, how much more that, both of the 
bishop and the whole church ? Therefore, he 
that assembleth not with you, is already 
proud, and hath condemned himself: for, it is^ 
written — ^ God resisteth the proud^' Let us 



give diligence, then^ not to resist the hisbop, 
that we may be under obedience to God. 

VI. And as much as any one beholdeth the 
bishop silent, the more let bim fear him : for, 
every man, whom the master of the house 
sendeth into his own stewardship, we ought 
so to receive, as him that sent hira. It be- 
hoveth us, therefore, to regard the bishop 
present to our sight, as the Lord himself. 
Truly, Ooesiraus himself exceedingly praisetb 
your good order in God ; that ye all live ac- 
cording to truth; and that in you no heresy 
dwelleth : nor indeed do ye even hear any one, 
except Jesus Christ speaking in truth. 

VII. For some are wont to hear about the 
name in wicked deceit, hut doing certain 
things unworthy of God, from whom you 
must turn away, as from wild beasts : for 
they tire rabid dogs, secret biters, whom, as 
they are with difficulty cured, you must g^ard 
agfunst. There is one physician, both having 
a body and being a spirit, born and not bom, 
made flesh, j/e/ God; in death, yet true life; 
both of Mary and of God, first passible and 
then impassible, Jesus Christ our Lord.'" 

V£II. Therefore let not any one deceive 



I 
J 



TO TUB KPHESIANS. Z9 

yoU) as indeed ye are not deceived, belong- 
ing wholly unto God. For when no strife 
has place among you, which can torment you, 
in truth ye live after God. May I be your 
oflFscouring and the purification of the church 
of you Ephesians, famous throughout the 
world. The carnal cannot do spiritual things, 
nor can the spiritual do things carnal;" as 
neither can faith do the things of unbelief, 
nor unbelief the things of faith. But what 
ye do even after the flesh, these are spiritual ; 
for ye do all in Jesus Christ. 

IX. But I have known some, who passed 
by you, having an evil doctrine ; whom ye did 
not suffer to sow among you, having stopped 
your ears, that ye might not receive the 
things sown by them, since ye are stones of 
the temple of the Father, having been pre- 
pared for the building; of God the Father, 
being raised up on high by the engine Jesus 
Christ, who is a cross ; using as a rope the 
Holy Ghost. And your faith is your leader 
upwards, and love the way which raiSeth 
up to God. Therefore ye are also all fellow- 
travellers, possessing God, temples of God, 
possessing Christ, possessing holiness, as 
pertaining to all things having been adorned 
with the commandments of Jesus Christ; 



iJ 



30 IGNATIUS 

in whom I also am glad, because I have beea 
counted worthy, by what I write, to hold 
converse with you, and to rejoice with you, 
that pertaining to another life ye love nothing, 
but only God. 

X. And also for other men pray without 
ceasing. For there is in them hope of 
repentance, that they may obtidn God. Per- 
mit them, then, even by your woi^s to be 
instructed by you. To their anger be ye 
meek, to their lofty speeches be ye humble^ 
minded ; unto their blasphemies do ye oppose 
prayers, to their error be ye steadfast in the 
faith, to their savage behaviour be ye mild. 
Not being zealous to imitate them in oppo- 
sition ; let us be found their brethren by 
moderation ; but let us be zealous to be fol- 
lowers of the Lord ; who has been more in- 
jured, who more spoiled, who more despised ? 
that not any plant of the devil may be found 
among you j but that ye may remain in per- 
fect chastity and temperance in Jesus Christ, 
bodily and spiritually. 

XI. What remains, are the last times ; let 
us stand in awe, let us fear the long- 
suffering of God, that it may not be to us in 
order to condemnation. For either let us

feat the future wrath, or love the present 
grace: one of the two only is found in Jesus 
Christ, In order to be truly alive. Without 
him let nothing be becoming unto you, in 
whom I carry about chains, spiritual jewels, 
in which may it be granted me to rise again 
by your prayer, of which prayer may I always 
be a partaker, that I may be found in the 
lot of Ephesians, the Christians, who always 
harmonized even with the apostles in the 
power of Jesus Christ. 

XII, 1 know who I am, and to whom I 
write ; I am under condemnation, ye are 
they who have obtained mercy ; I am under 
danger, ye are they who have been made 
sure. Ye are the passage of those who are 
slain to God; partakers of the same myste- 
ries with Paul the sanclified, the martyred, 
the most blessed, in whose footsteps may I 
be found, that I may obtain God, who in 
every epistle makes mention of you in Christ 
Jesus. 



XIll. Be diligent, therefore, more fre- 
quently to assemble for the giving of thanks, 
and for the glory of God ; for when ye con- 
tinually assemble, the powers of Satan are 
de8troyed> and by the UDaoimity of your 



fuur 



I 



faith his deadly snares are broken. Nothing 
is better than peace, by which all war of 
things heavenly and things earUily is made 
to cease. 

XIV. None of which tfaiags is hid from 
you, if ye have in sincerity faith and lore 
towards Jesus Christ, which are the begin- 
ning of life, and the end; tbe beginning, 
faith ; and the end, love ; but the two, when 
they are in unity, belong to God. And all 
other things are attendants on uprightness. 
No man professing faith, sinoetb, nor does 
he, that possessetb love, bate. The tree is 
known by its fruit ; so those professing to be 
Christians, shall be seen by what they do. 
For it i> not the work of present profession, 
but of tiuth in power,'^ that shall enable a 
man to be found to the end. 

XV. It is better to be silent and to be; 
tban to speak and not to be. It is good to 
teach, if a man do what be says. Therefore 
there is one teacher, who spake, and it was 
dune ; and also what he hath done in silence 
are worthy of the Father. He that possessetb 
tbe word of Jesus truly is able to hear even 
bis silence, that he may be perfect ; that 
wherein be speaketh, he may do ; and wherein 



I 

I 




TO THE EPHE8IAN8. 



^ 



be is silent, he may be known. Notbing ift 
hid from the Lord, but even our secrets are 
near unto him. Therefore, let us do all things^ 
as sensible that he dwelleth in us, that we' 
may be his temples, and he may be in us our 
God ; and what he is, shall also be manifested 
before our face, for which reasons we justly 
love him. 

XVI. Do not err, my brethren. The Cor- 
rupters of families siiall not inherit the king- 
dom of God. If then they, who after the 
flesh do these things, have died, how much 
more if any man corrupt the faith of God by 
evil doctrine, for which Jesus Christ was 
crucified ? ^^ Such a one being become filthy 
bhall go into unquenchable fire, and in like 
manner he that heareth him. 

XVII. For this cause, the Lord received 
ointment upon his head, that he mig^t 
breathe incorruption on thcf church. Be not 
ye anointed with the ill-saVour of the doe- 
trine of the Prints of this world, lest he lead 
you captive from the life set before you. 
But why are we not all become prudent, 
since we have received knowledge of God/ 
Which is Jesus Christ ? Why do we foolishly 



I

perish, being ignorant of the gift, which the 
Lord hath truly sent ? 

iCVtiI, My Spirit is the off-scouring of the 
crbs6,which is a stuinbling-hlock to them, that 
believe not; but to us salvation and life 
eternal. Where is the wise ? wliere the dis- 
puter? where the boasting of those called 
prudent? For our God Jesus the anointed 
was carried in the womb by Mary according 
to the dispensation of God, of the seed of 
David on the one hand, of the Holy Ghost on 
ihe 6ther hand ; who was born and was 
baptized, that our mortality might be 
cleansed.'^ 

XIX. And the virginity of Mary was hid 
from the Prince of this world, and her off- 
spring, and also the death of the Lord ; 
three proclaimed mysteries which were done 
of God in silence. How then was he mani- 
fested to the world ? A star shone in heaven 
above all the stars ; and the light thereof was 
inexpressible ; and the novelty of it caused 
perturbation. And all the other stars to- 
gether with the sun and moon, became a cho- 
rus to the star ; and it exceeded them all in 
■lilendor. And there was a commotion.

your prayer, and it be his will, in the second 
little book, which I am about to write unto 
you, I will manifest unto you the dispensation, 
which I have begun, pertaining to the new 
man Jesus Christ, in his faith, and in his 
love, in his suffering, and in his resurrection, 
especially if the Lord shall reveal unto me, 
that you all to a man, by favour proceeding 
from his name assemble together in public, in 
one faith, and in Jesus Christ, who according 
to the flesh is of the race of Dayid, the son pf 
man, and Son of God, in orde^ that you may 
obey the bishop and the presbytery with ai| 
undivided mind, breaking one bread, which 
is the medicine of immortality ; the antidote^ 
that we should not die, but live in Jesu^ 
Christ for ever.

gMng thanks to the Lord, loving Polycarp 
even as you. Remember me, as Jesus Christ 
remembers jon. Pray for the Church, whidi 
ijs in Syria; from whence I am led away 
bound unto Rome, being the last of the faith- 
ful there, as I have been counted worthy to be

THE 



EPISTLE OF IGNATIUS, 



BISHOP OF ANTIOCH AND MARTYR, 



TO THE 



MAGNESIANS. 



pe thai ioith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, 
is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his 
word, in hm verily is the love of God perfected : hereby 
knonD we that we are in him. He that saith he abideih in 
him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked, — 
1 John ii. 4, S, 6. 

I. Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to the 
church which is in Magnesia, on the Maean- 
der, which has been blessed by the grace of 
God the Father, in Jesus Christ our Saviour, 
in whom I salute ^ou, and pray j/ou to rejoice 
abundantly in God the Father and in Jesus 
Christ. Knowing the exceeding good order 
of your love pertaining to God, I rejoice to 



3^ IGNATIUS 

be beforehand in addressing you in the &itlf 
of Jesus Christ. For having been counted 
worthy of the name most becoming godliness, 
by the chains which I carry about, I celebrate 
the churches, among which I pray for oneness 
of the body and spirit of Jesus Christ, our 
eternal life, hoih of faith and love, lliaii which 
nothing has been judged better; and more 
eminently that (tf Jesms and the Father, ip 
whom enduring all the injury of the prince of 
this world, and having escaped it, we shall 
find God. 

11. I have then been deemed worthy to see 
you, through Damas, your right godly bishop, 
and your worthy elders,^ Bassus and ^P^U^ 
nius, and my fellow'^servant, Sotion,' the 
deacon, of whom I would have joy, because 
he is subject to the bishop, as to the gi*aCe of 
God, and to the presbytery, as to the law of 
Jesus Christ. 

IlL Moreover, it becomes you also not to 
disrespect the youth of the bisho|i, but as per- 
taining to the power of God the Father, to 
shew perfect reverence unto him ; as I know 
even the holy elders dof who have not regard- 
ed his apparent junior rank ; but who, as pru- 
dent in God, give place unto him : and not 



TO THE MAGNESIANS. 



3Si 



tinto him. but unto the Father of JesuB Christ. 

• • • 

the bishop of all. Therefore^ to the honor of 
nim. who hath willed tf. it becomes us to 
attend to him^ without any hypocrisy : since 
it is not that a man deceives this bishop, who 
is seen, but reasons against the invisible 
bishop. And with regard to such a one^ his 
speech is not against flesh, but against God, 
who knoweth the hidden things. 



I ) 



IV. Therefore it is fit not only to be calledi 
but als^o to be, Christians: some however name 
the bishop indeed ; but do all things without 
him. Biit such do not appear to me to have 
d^bod coniscience, because they are not firmly 
giathered together with Atm, according to the 
eoihmandment. 

y. However, things have an end ; and these 
two at the same time are at hand, both death 
and life, and every one is about to go to his 
own place. As there are two coins ; the one 
of God ; the other of the world ; and each of 
them has its own image impressed ; the unbe- 
lievers, the impression of this world ; but the 
faithfiil in love, the impression of God the 
Father, through Jesus Christ, through whom, 
unless we are able to die of our own choice,^^ 
in order to his sufiering, his life is not in us. 



40 IGNATIUS 

VI. Sincey then, in the persons aforemenV 
tioned9 1 have seen your whole multitude) in 
faith and love, I exhort you^ be zealous to do 
all things in one mind with God : the bishop 
presiding in the plaee of God, and the elders 
in the plaee of the council of the apostles, 
and the deacons, who are most dear to me, 
having been entrusted with the ministry of 
Jesus Christ, who before the worlds was with 
the Father, and in the end was made manifest. 
Do ye all then, having received like manners 
with God, reverence one another ; and let no 
man after the flesh regard his neighbour ; but 
in Jesus Christ love one another always. Let 
there be nothing among you which shall be 
able to divide you ; but be made one with the 
bishop, and with them that preside, for a 
figure and doctrine of incorruption. 

VII. As therefore the Lord did nothing 
without the Father, being united, neither by 
himself nor by the apostles ; so neither do ye 
any thing without the bishop and the elders. 
Do not even attempt that any thing should 
appear commendable unto you in private : but 
together let there he one prayer, one supplica-' 
tion, one mind, one hope, in love, in joy, 
undefiled. There is one Jesus Christ, than 
whom nothing is better. All therefore run 



TO THE MAGNESIANS* 41 

together as to a temple of God, as to oue 
altar, as to one Jesus Christ, who iame forth 
from olie Father, and to one essence hath 
returned. 

VIIL Be not deceived by strange opinions, 
nor by old fables which are unprofitable. For 
if we live until now according to Judaism, we 
confess that we have not received grace* For 
the most divine prophets lived after Christ 
Jesus. For this cause also they were perse^ 
cuted, being inspired by his grace, in order 
that the disobedient might be fully certified^ 
that there is one God, who hath manifested 
himself by Jesus Christ his Son, who is his 
eternal word, and did not come forth from 
silence ; who in all things did well please him 
that sent him. 

IX. If, therefore, they who dwelt undeir 
the old dispensation, came to the newness of 
hope, no longer keeping the sabbath, but 
living after the life of the Lord, in which also 
our life hath sprung up through him, and his 
death, which some deny : by which mystery 
we have received faith; and for this cause 
we endure, that we may be fouqd disdples of 
Jesus Christ, our only teacher, how shall wip 
be able to live without hiro, whose disciplci^ 

6 



42 IGNATIUS 

even the prophets were, and who in the spirit 
expected him as their teacher ? And for this 
cause he, whom they righteously waited for^ 
when he came, raised them from the dead. 

X. Let us^ therefore, not be insensible of 
his goodness. For if he shall do unto us ac-^ 
cording to our deeds — we are no more. For 
this cause, since we have become his disciples^ 
let us learn to live after Christianity. For 
he, who is called by another name more than 
this, is not of God. Therefore^ be placed 
above the evil leaven, which has grown old 
and sour, and be changed into the new leaven^ 
which is Jesus Christ. Be salted in him, that 
not one among you may be corrupted ; for by 
your savour ye shall be proved. It is absurd 
to name Christ Jesus, and to judaize. For 
Christianity hath not believed in Judaism, but 
Judidsm in Christianity, that every tongue 
which hath believed, should be gathered 
together unto God. 

XI. My beloved, not because I know that 
any of you are so affected, do I thus write^ 
but as less than you, I wish to forewarn you^ 
not to rush upon the hooks of vain-glory, but 
to be fiilly assured in the birth, and the suffer- 
ing, and the resurrection, which took place in 



TO THB MAONF81AN8. 48 

the time of the goverainent of Pontius Pilate : 
things that were done truly and steadfastly 
by Jesus Christ, our hope, from which may it 
not happen to any of you to be turned aside. 

XIL Let me have joy of you in all things, 
if I be worthy. For although I am bound, 
I ani not equal to one of you that are firee. I 
know that ye are not puffed up : for ye have 
Jesus Christ in yourselves. And when I 
praise you the more, I know that ye are 
ashamed: as it is written — ^that the just 
man is his own accuser.* 

XIIL Be zealous, therefore, to be esta- 
blished in the institutions of the Lord and of 
the apostles, that in all things whatsoever ye 
do, ye may be prospered in body and spirit, 
in faith and love, in the Sou, and the Father^ 
and in the spirit, in the beginning and in the 
end, with your most esteemed bishop, and 
your well platted spiritual wreath, the pres- 
bytery, and the deacons (servants) in the 
things of God. Be subject to the bishop, to 
one another, as Jesus Christ to the Father 
as touching his manhood ; and as the apostles 
to Christ, and to the Father, and to the spirit, 
that there may be oneness both of body and 
spirit. 



44 IGNATIUS TO THE MAGNJBSIANS. 

XIV. Knowing that ye are fall of God, I 
have concisely exhorted you. « Remember me 
in your prayers, that I may attain unto Qod : 
and the church in Syria, from whence I am 
not worthy to be called. For I stand in need 
of your prayer and love, united in God, in 
order that the church in Syria may be counted 
worthy of being bedewed by your church. 

XV. The Ephesians salute you from Smyr- 
nai from whence also I write unto you ; they 
are here to the glory of God, as are you also, 
who have refreshed me in all things^ together 
with Polycarp, bishop of the Smymaeans. 
And also the other churches, in honor of 
Jesus Christ, salute you. Be strong in the 
unanimity of God, possessing an undivided 
spirit, which is Jesus Christ.

loved of God, the li^ather df Jestis Ghtiist, 
elect, and fruitfiil unto God, enjoy i^peat^e 
in the body and bloody the sufleritig of J^iis 
Christ, our hope; in the resurrection unto 
him : which I also salute in the plenitude^ in 
the apostolic character^ and wish much joy. 



46 IGNATIUS 

I know that you have a mind undefiled, and 
which doubts not in trial, not by habits but by 
birth: as Polybius, your bishop, has shewn 
unto me, who, by the will of God and of Jesus 
Christ, has come to Smyrna, and so rejoiced 
with me, a prisoner in J^sus Christ, that in 
him I have seen your whole multitude. 
Having then received your godly benevolence 
through him, I gloried in finding you, as I 
know you are followers of God. 

IL For when ye are subject to the bishop, 
as to Jesus Christ, ye appear to me to live not 
after man, but after Jesus Christ, who died 
for us, that having believed in his death, ye 
should escape death. It is necessary, there-, 
fore, that as ye do, so ye should do nothing 
without the bishop : but be subject also to the 
presbytery, as to the apostles of Jesus Christ, 
our hope, in whom we should be found passing 
our life. Moreover, it behoves also the dea- 
cons, being the mystery of Jesus Christ, by 
all means to please all. For they are not 
deacons of meats and drinks, but servants of 
the church of God. It behoves them, there- 
fore, to guard against crimes as fire. 

II [. In like manner let all reverence the 
deacons, as Jesus Christ, even as the Over- 



TO tHS TRALLIANS. 47 

teer, who is the Son of the Father : and the 
ielderS) as the council of God, and as the bond 
of the apostles. Without these, a church is 
not called: concerning which things, I am 
persuaded that you so do. For the pattern of 
your love I have received, and have with me 
in your bishop ; whose very behaviour is great 
instruction ; and his meekness, power : whom 
I consider that even those esteem, who are 
without God, loving him. Since I am able to 
write for him, I spare not so to do very con- 
cisely^ being induced to this, that being con- 
demned as an apostle, I may command you. 

IV. I have much understanding in God: 
but I limit mysd^/ lest I should perish in 
boasting. For now it behoves me the more 
to fear, and not to give heed to those that puff 
me up. For by their speech they chastise 
me. Truly, I love to suffer ; but know not if 
I am worthy. To th^ multitude, indeed, my 
zeal doth not appear ; but in me it warreth 
the more. I stand in need, therefore, of 
meekness, by which the prince of this world 
is overthrown. 

V. Am I not able to write of heavenly 
things 9 but I fear lest being babes I should 
^rove injurious to you : and (pardon me) lest 



48 IGNATIUS 

not being enabled to receive k^. ye Aaald 
he strangled. For even I also^ by reasmi< of 
being bound, am notable to umdemtand ^buit 
m part heavenly things, and^ i3ai»' angelie 
orders, and the i4>pointnients of. the princes, 
both things visible and invisible. McHraovon^ 
even now I am a disciple. For mSahy thli^^a 
are lacking mito us, that we should not- be 
lacking of God. 

VL Therefore I exhort you, not I, but dw 
love of Jesus Christ, ta use Obristian nouriedi^^ 
ment only, and to' abstain from strange luM^be^ 
which is heresy. For the heretics, believed 
in according to their dignity, mix up Jesus 
Chriiit, as (ibose who a^inlster a deadly 
Antg with mead, which he, that is ignorant^ 
dweetly recdveth with gladness, and -death 
thei^With. 

« 

VII. Be on your guard therefore against 
such. And so shall you be, if not puffin up, 
nor separated from God Jesus Christy and thte 
bishop, and the constitutions of the apostles. 
Whoso is within the altar is pure ; but whoso 
is without, is not pure : that is, he that doeth 
aiijrthing without the bishop, and the presby- 
tefry, and the deacon ; this man is not pure 
in his conscience. 



T(l THE TRALLIANS. 49 

VIII. Not that I know of any such thing 
iimong you, but I forewarn you, who are my 
beloved, foreseeing the plots of the devil. 
Do ye, therefore, having received a kind 
affection, build yourselves anew io faith^ 
which is the flesh of the Lord ; and in lovej 
which is the blood of Jesus Christ. Let none 
of you have ought against his neighbour. 
Give not occasions to the gentiles, that by a 
few foolish people the multitude in God may 
not be evil spoken of. For woe unto Aim, 
through whom in vanity my name is by any 
evil spoken of. 

IX. Be ye deaf then, when any one speaks 
unto you without Jesus Christ, who is of the 
race of David, who is of Mary, who was truly 
born, did both eat and drink, was truly per- 
secuted under Pontius Pilate, was truly cruci- 
fied and died, in the sight of those in heaven, 
those on earth, and those under the earth : 
who also was truly raised from the dead ; his 
Father having raised him ; as after his like- 
ness his Father will so raise in Christ Jesus 
ns also, who believe in him, without whom 
■we have no true life. 

X. But if, as some, who are without God, 
that is unbelievers, say, that he suffered in 



L- - 



50 IGNATIUSi 

appearance^ themselves existing in appear^ 
anee,^^ why am I bound ? and why do I desire 
to fight with wild-beasts ? I die then in vain t 
in truth then I lie against the Lord. 

XI. Flee then the evil sprouts, which pro-^ 
duce deadly firuit, of which if any taste, he 
immediately dies. For these are not the 
planting of the Father. If they were, they 
would shew themselves branches of the cross ; 
and their fruit would be incorruptilde : by 
which crossy in his suffering, he calleth unto 
him you, who are his members. The head 
then apart cannot exist, without the mem- 
bers ; God engaging oneness which is him- 
self« 

XII. I saiute you from Smyrna, together 
with the churches of God, who are present 
with me, which have in all things refreshed 
me, both in body and spirit. My bonds ex- 
hort you, which for the sake of Jesus Christ 
I. carry about, desiring to obtain God. Peiv 
severe in your unanimity and in prayer with 
one another. For it becomes you indivi- 
dually and especially the elders, to refresh 
the bishop, to the honor of the Father of 
Jesus Christ, and of the apostles. I intreat 
you in love to hear me, that I may not be for 



TO THE TKALLIANS. 



51 



a testimony agaiDst you, when I have written. 
And pray ye also for me, who stand in need 
of your love in the tender mercy of God, in 
order that I may be counted worthy of the 
inheritance, which I go about to obtain, that 
I may not be found a reprobate. 

XTIL The love of the Smyrnaeans and 
Ephesians saluteth you. Remember in your 
prayers the church in Syria: from whence 
T am not even wortiiy to be called, being the 
last of them. Be ye strong in Jesus Christ, 
subject to the bishop, as to the command- 
ment, and likewise to the presbytery. And 
love ye one another individually with an un-^ 
divided heart. My spirit be your purifica- 
tion, not only now, but also when I have 
obtained God. For as yet I am under danger: 
but faithful is the Father in Jesus Christ to 
fulfil my petition and your s, in whom may yQ 
he found without spot,

EPISTLE OF IGNATIUS, 



BISHOP OF ANTIOCH AND MARTYR, 



TO TBB 



ROMANS. 



The Spkii Useff beareih wUmeu with <mr tpirii, ikai we are ike

amd jomi hein with CkrUi ; if 90 be ikai we smjfer wiik kim^

L IGNATIU89 also caUed Theophorus to the 
church,^^ which has obtained mercy in the 
Majesty of the most High Father, and of 
Jesus Christ his only Son, the church beloved 
and enlightened by the will of him, who hath 
willed all things, which are according to the 
love of Jesus Christ our God, which also is a 



IGNATIUS TO THE ROMANS. 53 

garrison of the Romans in the place of a 
castle* godly, well adorned, most blessed, 
praiseworthy, prevailing, pure, and pre- 
eminent in love, named after Christ, named 
after the Father,'^ and which I salute in the 
name of Jesus Christ the son of the Father; 
to you who are united in body and spirit to 
all his commandment, and filled with the 
favor of God in sincerity, and strained off 
from every foreign colouring, much pure joy 
in Jesus Christ our God. Since by prayer to 
God, I have attained to behold your godly 
faces, and as I more desired to attain it, bound 
in Christ Jesus, I hope to salute you, if it be 
the will of God that I be counted worthy to 
continue unto the end. The beginning indeed 
is well-ordered, if I but obtain favor to 
receive my inheritance without hindrance. 
For I fear your love, lest it should injure me. 
For unto you it is an easy matter to do what 
ye desire; but to me it is difficult to attain 
unto God, if ye spare me. 

II. I do not wish you to be man-pleasers, 
but to please God, as also ye do please him. 
For I shall never have such an opportunity to 
attain unto God ; nor ye, if ye be silent, to 
be inscribed on a better work. For if ye be 
silent concerning mc, 1 shall be with God : 




^ IGNATICS 

but if ye be enamoared of my flesh, I shall 
again have to run. Too eould not graat me 
mere than to be offimed op to Giod, while yet 
the altar is |Hrepared : tiiat brai^ made a 
dioms in love, yon may sii^ to the Fadi^r in 
Christ Jesns; that Grod having' sent for the 
Bishop of Syria firom the ^ist hath eoonted 
him worthy to be found in the West. It is 
g€KMi to set from the worid wiUi Crod, tiiat to 
him I may rise. 

IIL Te have never envied any one : ye 
have taoght others. And I desire, Uiat those 
things may also be established, whieh when 
teadiing ye gave in charge. Only ask for 
strength for 'me both internal and external, 
that I may not only sat ; but also wiUi : that 
1 may not only be called a CSiristian; but 

also may be found one. For if I be found 
one, I can be called one too ; and can then 
be faithful, when 1 appear not to the world. 
Nothing that appeareth is eternal. * The 
things that are seen are temparaly hut the things 
that are not seen^ are eternalS Yea our God 
Jesus Christ, being in the Father, appeareth 
the more. Christianity is not the work of 
silence only, but of greatness. 

IV. I write to vthe churches, and I charge 



TO THE ROMANS. 55 

them all, that I die willingly for God, if ye 
hinder me not. I beseech you, be not unrea- 
sonably benevolent towards me. Suffer me to 
be the food of wild beasts, by which it is 
allowed me to attain unto God. I am the 
corn of God : and by the teeth of wild beasts 
1 would be ground, that I may be found pure 
bread of Christ. Do ye rather encourage the 
wild beasts, that they may become my sepul- 
chre, and may leave nothing of my body,^^ 
that when I have fallen asleep, I may not be 
burdensome to any one. Then I shall be 
truly a disciple of Ohrist, when the world 
shall not see even my body. Pray ye Christ 
for me, that by these instruments I may be 
found a sacrifice. I do not, as Peter and Paul, 
command you. They were apostles; I am a 
condemned man : they were free ; but I am a 
bondman until now. However, if I suffer, I 
shall be a freedman of Jesus, and vshall rise 
again free in him. Now I learn, since I am 
bound, to lust after nothing worldly or vain. 

V. From Syria unto Rome I fight with wild 
beasts, by land and by sea, night and day, 
bound unto ten leopards, which is a guard of 
soldiers ; who are made worse by kind treat- 
ment. But by their injuries I am the more 
instructed : yet am I not hereby justified. I 



59 IGNATIUS 

would have profit of the wild beasts, that 
have been prepared for me, and I pray that 
they may be found ready : which I will even 
encourage to devour nae speedily : not as with 
some, whoTTii as if afraid, they did not touch. 
Even if they themselves, unwilling, will not 
devour me, I will ui^e them to it. Pardon 
me ; I know what is expedient for me. Now 
I begin to be a disciple. Let nothing visible 
or invisible, rival tne ; that I may obtain 
Jesus Christ. Let fire and cross, and compa- 
nies of wild beasts, scattering of bones, crush- 
ing of limbs, grinding of the whole body, evil 
buffetings of the devil come upon me : so that 
1 only obtain Jesus Christ. 

VI. The pleasures of this world shall profit 
me nothing, nor the kingdoms thereof. I had 
rather die unto Christ Jesus, than reign over 
the ends of the earth. * For what shall it 
profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and 
lose his own soul 9' Him I seek, who died for 
us : him I long for, who rose again on our 
account. And my gain lies at hand. Pardon 
me, brethren : hinder me not from living; do

man ; and this shall be, if ye will. Do ye 
desire it^ that ye also may be desired. In a 
few words, I beg of you, believe me. And 
Jesus Christ shall manifest this unto you, that 
I speak truly : my mouth is without falsehood, 
in which the Father hath spoken truly. Pray 
for me, that I may obtain. I have not written 
unto you according to the flesh, but according 
to the will of God. If I suffer, ye have de- 
sired meg if I be rejected, ye have hated me. 

IX. Remember in your prayer the church in 
Syria, which instead of me, ei]goys Ck>d for & 
shepherd. Jesus Christ alone shall overlook 
it, and your love. But I am ashamed to be 
counted one of them. For I am not even 
worthy, being the last of them, and an un- 
timely birth: but I have obtained mercy to 
be some one, if I shall attain unto God. My 
spirit saluteth you, and the love of the 
churches^ which have received me in the 
name of Jesus Christ, not as passing by : for 
even those, which were not near to me in the 
way, that is, after the flesh, went before me 
according to their cities. 

X. And I write this unto you from Smyrna, 
by Ephesians, who are most blessed. And 
there is also with me, together with many

Concerning those, who went before me from 
Sjrria to Rome, to the glory of God, I believe 
that you have heard; to whom also make it 
known, that I am near. For they are all 
worthy of God, and of you : whom it is fit 
that you should in all things refresh. 1 wrote 
this unto you on the tenth of the calends of 
September, (that is, the twenty-third of 
August). Be strong to the end, in the 
patience of Jesus Christ. Amen.

among whom I have spoken, that they may

VII. For although some after the flesh 
wished to deceive me, the spirit however 
being from God is not deceived. For it 
knoweth, whence it cometh and whither it 
goeth, and reproveth the hidden things. I 
cried out, when I was among you ; I spake 
with a loud voice : attend to the bishop, and 
to the presbytery and deacons. And they 
suspected that I spake these things, as baviog 
previously known of the division of some : 
but he is ray witness, in whom I am bound, 
that from human flesh I knew it not. But 
the spirit proclaimed, saying thus : do nothing 
without the bishop: keep your body as the 
temple of God : love unity: flee divisions; 
be followers of Jesus Christ, as he also of 
his Father. 

VIII. I then in truth did as became me, 
as a man devoted to unity. But wliere divi- 
sion is and anger, God dwelleth not. There- 
fore to all the penitent the Lord giveth remis- 
sion, if they repent to the unity of God, and

Lthe council of the bishop. I trust in the ^H 
charity of Jesus Christ, who will loose every ^H 



TO THE PHILADELPHIANS. 65 

bond from you. And I exhort you to do 
nothing in contention,^' but according to the 
discipline of Christ. ^Vlien I heard some 
saying, that ' unless I find it in the ancients, 
I do not believe in the gospel:' and when I 
said to them, that it is written, they answer- 
ed me, that ' it is set forth.' But Jesiis Christ 
is my ancient writings ; the undefiled ancient 
writings are his cross and death, and his re- 
surrection, and the faith which is through him : 
in which by your prayer I desire to be justified. 

fX. The priests also are good : but better 
is the High Priest, who has been entrusted 
with the Holy of Holies, who atone has been 
entrusted with the secrets of God : being 
himself the door of the Father, through which 
Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and the pro- 
phets, and the apostles, and the church enter 
in. All these assent to the unity of God. But 
especially what the gospel contains, the pre- 
sence of the Saviour our Lord Jesus Christ, 
the suffering of him, and the resurrection. 
For the beloved prophets published tidings 
relating unto him : but the gospel is the 
finishing of incorruption. All together are 
good, if ye believe in love. 
!.i.ai ■■■■ ! ■ ,. , 

'■Qtr NowsimW according to your prayer, 




and according; to the compassion, which ye 
have in Christ Jesus, it has been told rae that 
the chureh, which is in Antioeh of Syria 
enjoys peace : it becomcth you, as a church 
of God to appoint a servant to go thither 
with a divine mission, in order to rejoice with 
them, when assembled together, and to glorify 
his name. Blessed in Jesus Christ is he, who 
shall be counted worthy of such a service ; 
and ye shall be glorified. If you have the 
desire, it is not an impossible work for the 
name of God ; as also the neighbouring 
churches have sent bishops, and others elders 
and deacons. 

XI. ConcerniDg Philo the deacon from 
Cilicia, a man testified of, who also now in 
the word of God ministers unto me, together 
with Reus Agatbopus a chosen man, who 
follows me from Syria, having bid farewell 
to life, they both testify of you, and I give 
thiuiks to God for you, that ye received them, 
as the Lord also receives you. But as for 
those, who dishonored them, may they be 
redeemed by the charity of Jesus Christ. 
The love of the brethren, who are in Troas 
salutetb you : from whence also I write unto 
you by Burrhus, who was sent with me from 
the Ephesians and Siuyrnseans for the word

EPISTLE OF IGNATIUS, 



BISHOP OF ANTIOCH,'AND MARTYR, 



TO 



POLYCARP. 



4ind unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write} these 
things saUh the first and the last, which was dead, and is 
aU/oe; I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (hut 
ihou art rich), and I know the blasphemy of them which say 
they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.'*-* 
Rev. ii. 8, 9. 

I. Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to Poly- 
carp, overseer of the church of SmymaBanSf 
yea rather, overseen of God the Father and 
the Lord Jesus' Christ, much joy. 

Approving of thy mind in God, established 
as upon an immoveable rock,^ I exceedin^y 
^ve glory, having been accounted worthy ta 
behold thy blameless face, of which I would 



ICNATIUS TO rOLTCARP. d9 

have joy in God. I exhort thee by the favor 
of God, with which thou art clothed, to add 
to thy race, and to exhort all, that they may 
be saved. Vindicate thy office with the ut- 
most carefulness, both of body and of spirit. 
Study unity, than which nothing is better. 
Bear all, as also the Lord beareth thee. En- 
dure all in love, even as thou dost. Have 
leisure for unceasing prayers. Ask for more 
understanding than thou hast. Watch, pos- 
sessing a sleepless spirit. Speak to them 
individually, after the conversation of God. 
Bear the infirmities of all, as a perfect wrest- 
ler. Where there is more labour, the gain U 
much. 

IL Jf thou lovest the good disciples, thou 
hast no thanks, rather in meekness bring into 
subjection the more pestilential. Every 
wound is not healed by the same plaister. 
Subdue the inflamed by embrocations. Be 
wise as a serpent in all things, and harmless 
as a dove. Fur this cause thou art composed 
of body and spirit, that thou mayest treat 
gently the things that appear before thy face : 
but ask, that the invisible things may be made 
manifest unto tbee, that thou mayest lack none, 
and abound in every gift. The time demands 
thee, as pilots the winds ; and as the weather- 



\ 



beaten mariner demands the port, in order to 
attain unto God. Be vijirilant, as a wrestler 
of God ; the prize is ineorruption and life 
eternal, concerniD^ which thou also art con- 
fident. In every thing let my life go for thine, 
and my bonds* n'hichthou host lored. 

III. Let those who seem to be worthy of 
belief, and teach another doctrine, not daunt 
thee. Stand firm as an anvil, when it is 
beaten. It is the excellence of a great wrest- 
ler to be battered, and yet to conquer : but, 
above all, for the sake of God, it behoves us 
to sustain all things, that he also may sustain 
us. Be more zealous than thou art. Consider 
the times : keep looking for him who is above 
time, the timeless, the invisible, for us made 
visible, him that could not be handled, the 
impassible, for us made passible, who all 
manner of ways endured for us. 

IV. Let not widows be neglected. After 
the Lord, be thou their guardian. Let nothing 
be done without thy will, nor do thou any 
thing without God !^' which indeed thou dost 
not, being stable. Let assemblies be held 
more frequently : search out all by name. 
Disdain not bondmen and hond-women 
yet let them be putfed up, rather . let

"Sfi^ye^ the more to the glory of God| that they 
may obtain a better liberty frcmi God. Let 
tjaem not desire to be made free at the public 
charge^ lest they should be found slaves of 
lust; 

y. Flee evil arts : yea, rather hold no con- 
versation about them. Speak to my sisters, 
that they love the Lord, and be content with 
their husbands, in body and spirit. Likewise 
declare also to my brethren, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, that they love their wives, as 
tibe Lord the church. If any one can continue 
in chastity, to the honor of the Lord of his 
body, let him continue without boasting. If 
he boast, he is lost: and if he should be 
noticed more than the bishop, he has been 
corrupted. It becometh the men and women 
that marry, to make their union with the will 
of the bishop ; that the marriage mi^ be after 
God, and not after ^st. Let all things be 
done to the honor of God. 

VI. Give heed to the bishop, thaH God also 
may to you. Let my life go for tiiose wlw 
ajre subject to the bishop, the elders, Ae dea^ 
cof9 : and witli them may it be granted me Ut 
have part, in God* Labour one with anotiier, 
strive together, run togethel*, suffer together. 



fall asleep together, rise together, as stewards 
of God, and helpers, and servants. Please 
him, for whom ye wage war, from whom 
also ye receive your wages. Let not any of 
you be found a deserter. Let your baptism 
remain as arms, taith as a helmet, love as a 
spear, patience as the whole armour. Your 
deposits are your deeds : that you may receive 
returns worthy of you. Bear long, therefore, 
one with another in meekness, as God bears 
with you. Let me have joy of you always. 

Vn. And since the church, which is in 
Antioch, of Syria, enjoys peace, as it has been 
declared unto me, through your prayer, and I 
am become more cheerful in the security of 
God, (if, however, through the suffering, I 
attfUQ unto God, so as to be found in the 
resurrection your disciple), it becometh (ftee, 
most blessed Polycarp, to hold a council 
becoming God, and to appoint one, whom ye 
exceedingly regard, an active man, who shall 
be able to be called a divine messenger ; to 
account this man worthy to go into Syria, that 
he may glorify your active love to the glory 
of Christ. A Christian has not the power of 
himself, but he is at leisure for God. This 
worlf is God's, and yours, when ye shall hare 
performed it. For I trust to your charity,

cause I must immediately sail from Troas to 
NeapoHs, thou stialt irrite to the churefie^ 
beyond thee, as one that possesseth the mind 
of God, that they also may do the same : let 
those, who are able, send m&inengers on foot : 
and the others, epistles by those whom thou 
shalt send, that thou mayest be glorified in 
the eternal work, since thou art worthy. I 
saJute all by name, and the wife of Epitropusj 
with her whole house, and the children. I 
salute Attains, my beloved. I salute him, tvho 
shall be counted worthy to go into Syria. 
Grace shall be with him always, and with 
Polycarp that sends him. I pray that you 
may be strong always in our God Jesus Christ, 
in whom may ye continue in the ufiity and

L Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to the 
ehureh of God the Father, and of his beloved

love, not lacking in any gift, most godly and 
holy, which is in Smjrma of Asia, much joy 
in the undefiled spirit and word of God. 
I glorify Jesus Christ God, who has made 



IGNATIUS TO THE SMYRN^ANS. 75 

you SO wise: for I perceived that you were 
settled in an immoveable faith, as if nailed on 
tile cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, both in 
body and spirit, and established in love in the 
blood of Christ, having been fully certified 
with regard to our Lord, that he is truly of 
the race of David according to the flesh, the 
Son of God, according to the will and power 
of God, having been truly made of a virgin, 
baptized by John, that atl righteousness should 
be fulfilled by him, truly nailed for us in his 
body under Pontius Pilate and Herod the 
Tetrarch, (of the fruit of which are we, of his 
divinely blessed suflering,) that he might 
raise up a joint-standard for ever by his 
resurrection for his saints and faitbful,whether 
among the Jews or Gentiles, in one body of 
Ids. church^ 

IL For all: these things he sufi'ered for us, 
that we should be saved. And he suffered 
truly, as he also truly raised up himself: not, 
as some unbelievers say, that he suffered in 
appearance, themselves existing in appear- 
ance, and as they thinlt, so shall it happen 
UDto them, being incorporeal and devilish. 

III. For I know and believe that even alter 
his resurrection he is incarnate. And when 



J 



$9 IGNATIUS 

he came unto them, that were with Peter, he 
8ud unto them : take hold, handle me, and 
see, that 1 am not an incorporeal spirit. And 
immediately they touched him and believed, 
being convinced by his body and spirit. For 
this cause, they despised even death, and 
were found above death. And after his 
Tesurrection he eat and drank with them, as 
harmg a body, although spiritually united to 
the Father. 

IV. And of these things I admonish yuu, 
beloved, knowing that ye also so understand. 
But 1 forewarn you of wild beasts in the 
shape of men : whom ye must not only not 
receive, but if it is possible, not evea meet 
with, but only pray for them, if by any means 
they may repent, which is difficult. But of 
this Jesus Christ, our true life has the power. 
For if these things were done in appearance 
by our Lord, I also am bouud in appearance. 
And why have 1 also given myself to be deli- 
vered to death, to :fire, to sword, to wild 
beasts ? But near the sword, near to God ; 
in the midst of wild beasts, in the midst of 
God. Only in the name of Jesus Christy in 
order to suffer with him, I endure all things ; 
while he who was made a perfect man, 
strengthens me. 



I 




TO THE SMYRN^ANS. 

V. Whom some ignorant persona deny, 
yea, rather have been denied by biin, being 
preachers of death rather than of the truth : 
whom the prophecies have not persuaded, 
nor the law of Moses, nay, nor even the 
gospel until now, nor our own individual 
sufferings. For they think also the same con- 
cerning us. For what does any man profit 
me, if he praiseth me, but blasphemeth my 
Lord, not confessing that he was made flesh? 
He that doth not say this, has completely 
denied him, being possessed of death. But 
their names, as they are unbelievers, I have 
not thought it fit to write ; yea, far be it from 
me to mention them, till they have become 
converts to the suflering, which is our resur- 
rection. 

VI. Let no man err. Even if the heavenly 
powerst and the glory of the angels, and the 
princes, both visible and invisible, have not 
believed in the blood of Christ, even to them 
it is condemnation. He that receiveth, let 
him receive. Let condition puff up no man, 
for faith and love are the whole, than which 
nothing has been judged better. But con- 
sider them, that think contrary to the grace 
of Jesus Christ, which has come unto us, how 
opposite they are to the will of God. 'I'hey 




care not for love, nor for the widow, nor for 
the orphan, nor for the afflicted, nor for the 
bound, nor the loose, nor for the hungry, nor 
the thirsty. 

VII. They abstain from thanksgiving (the 
eucharist) and prayer, because they confess 
not that the thanksgiving is the body of our 
Saviour Jesus Christ,^ which suffered for our 
sins, which in bis goodness the Father raised 
up. They therefore, that contradict the gift 
of God in their disputing, perish. But it 
would be profitable for them to love, that they 
might also rise again. It becometh us then 
to abstain from such, and to speak of thent 
neither in private, nor in public : but to give 
heed to the prophets, and especially to the 
gospel, in which the suffering has been mani- 
fested unto us, and the resurrection com- 
pleted. But Ree divisions, as the beginning of 
evils. 

VIII. All follow the bishop, as Jesus Christ, 
the Father ; and the presbytery, as the apos- 
tles : and reverence the deacons, as the com- 
mandment of God. Let no man apart from 
the bishop do any thing, that pertains to 
the church. Let that thanksgiving be con- 
sidered established, which is under the bishop, 



I 




or whomsoever he shall have commissioned. 
Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let 
the multitude be: as wheresoever is Jesus 
Christ, there is the Catholic church.^ It is 
Qot lawful apart trom the bishop, neither to 
baptize, nor to make a love-feast ; but what- 
ever he shall approve, this is well-pleasing 
also to God, that everything which is done 
may be sure and steadticist. 

IX. It is highly proper that we should 
for the remtuning time renew our vigilance ; 
and repent toward God, while we yet have 
opportunity. It is well to have knowledge 
both of God and the bishop. He that honoreth 
the bishop, has been honored of God : he that 
hideth from the bishop any thing that he 
does, serveth the devil. Let all things there- 
fore among you abound in charity ; for ye 
are worthy. Ye have in all things refreshed 
ine, and Jesus Christ you. Ye have loved 
me absent and present. God recompense 
you, for whom enduring all things, ye will 
obtain him.

I. When Trajan had now succeeded to the 
Roman empire, Ignatius, the disciple of the 
apostle John, a man in all respects apostolic^ 
governed the church of the people of Antioch 
diligently; with difficulty passing through 
the former storms of many persecutions^ 
under Domitian; as a good pilot, by the 
helm of prayer and fasting, and by constant 
preaching with spiritual vigor, he withstood 
the opposing hurricane ; fearing lest it should

simple. Ther^ore he rejoiced indeed at die 
ateadfastoess of the church, when the perse? 
entiion had for awhile abated ; bat he grieved 
within hin^^elf, because he had not reached 
true love towa|rds Christ, nor the perfect rank 
of the disciple. For he considered the con-r 
fession - inade by * nniartyrdonl * OM joliik%i liim 
more intimately unto the Lord. Whence 
remaining ^ f<^iv years Iqngerwlth^^tie church, 
like a divine lamp, enlightening ttie mind of 
each, through the exposition of the scriptures, 
}^e obtained his heart*s desire. 

Ih , For after this, when Trajan* in the nintli 
year of his reign, had been lifted up hy his 
victory over the Scjrthians and Dacians; and 
inany other tiations, and thinking that the 
religious system of the Christiaiis was yet

IGNATIUS. 85 

when he stood in the presence of Trajan, the 
emperor, the following dialogue entued : — 

Trajftn. Who art thou, evil spirit, that 
zealously transgressest our commands, and 
withal persuadest others, that they may 
miserably perish? 

Ignatius said : No man calletfa Theophorus, 
evil spirit : for the devils have departed from 
the servants of God. But if, because I am 
odious to them, thou callest me evil against 
the spirits, I grant it : for I possess Christ, 
the heavenly king, and confound their devices. 

Trajan said: And who is Theophorus? 
Ignatius answered ; He that has Christ in his 
breast. 

Trajan said : Do we then seem to thee not 
to have Gods in our hearts, whom also we 
enjoy as allies against the enemies? 

Ignatius said ; In naniing the devils of the 
Gientiles, gods, thou errest. For there is one 
God, who made the heaven, and the earth, 
and the sea, and all things that are therein ; 
and one Christ Jesus, the only begotten Son 
of God, whose kingdom may I enjoy. 

Trajan said: Him, who was crucified, 
sayest thou, under Pontius Pilate? 

Ignatius said : Him, who has crucified again 
my sin, with the inventor thereof, and has 
condemned all the error and malice of the 



99 MARTYRDOM OF 

Aev\l under the feet of those, who beur him 
io their heart. 

Trajan said : Dost thou then carry trtthio 
thyself him who was erucifled ? 

Ignatius said: Yea. For it istrritten; / 
will dwell in them, and will voalh tn them. 

Trajan declared: We have ordered Igna- 
tius, who says that fae carries abbot within 
him, him that was crucified, to be made a 
prisoner by the soldiers, and to be conducted 
to great Rome, in order to become the fotid of 
wild beasts, for the entertsunment of the 
I»ettple. 

When the faoly martyr heard this «eHtefioe 
he cried out with joy : I thank thee, O Lord, 
that thou hast thought fit to honor me with 
perfect love towards thee, and to bind me, 
with thy apostle Paul, in fetters of Iroti. 
When he had thus spoken, and put Ms chains 
with joy about him, having first prayed for 
the church, and commended it with tears to 
the Lord, as a goodly ram, the leader of a 
good flock, he was dragged, by the fierce 
cruelty of the military, in order to be led 
away to Rome, for food for blood-devouring

joy, firom his desire of suffering, when fae had _

IGNATinO^M Hi 

come down from ADtioch to Seleucia, he was 
from, theoce conducted by sea: and haviog 
arrived* after much Gatigue, at the city of the 
Sinyrnseans, with much joy he went on shore 
and hastened to visit the holy Polycarp, the 
bishop of the Smyrneaans, his fellow-hearer: 
for they bad formerly been, disciples of the 
holy Apostle, John : to whom when he had 
been brought, and had communicated to him 
spiritual gifts, and rejoiced in his bonds, he 
exhorted to strive together with him in his 
purpose, ^exceedingly Indeed every church in 
public : (for the cities and churches of Asia 
by their bishops, elders, and deacons, em- 
braced theSaint, all pressing forward to him, 
in hopes. of receiving aportion of his spiHtual 
gift), but in a peculiar manner the holy 
Polycarp, that through the means of the wild 
beasts he might quickly be out of sight of the 
world, and appear in the presence of Christ. 

IV. And these things he thus spalte, and 
thus testified : extending his love to Christ so 
far, as to be on the point of i*eceiving heaven 
l>y a good confession, and the earnestness of 
those that prayed with him for the contest; 
and as to return the favor to the churches 
that met him by their rulers, giving them 
thanks by letters sent unto them, which dis- 



mB MARTYBDOH OF 

tilled spiritual charity, witii prayer and ex-» 
hortatioD. Tlierefore when he saw them all 
kindly disposed towards him, he feared lest 
the affection of the brotherhood should impede 
his haste to his Lord, now that an excellent 
door of martyrdom was opened unto him, so 
he sends an epistle as follows to the church 
of the Romans. — See the Epistle to the Romang. 

Vi Then when he had by letter reanimated,- 
as he desired, those of the brethren in Rome 
who were unwilling, he was thus conveyed 
from Smyrna, and arrived at Troas. For 
the child of Christ was urged on by the sol- 
diers in order to be in time for the games in 
great Rome, that he might be delivered to 
the wild beasts in the sight of the Roman 
people, and obtain the crown of the contest. 
And then, having been conveyed thence to 
Neapolis, he journeyed through Macedonia, 
by way of Fhilippi, and about the mainland 
towards Epidamnus ; having obtained a ship 
on the sea-coasts, he sailed over the Adriatic 
sea, and going from thence into the Tyr- 
rheniaii,andpassingby islands and cities, when 
Potioli was shewn to the Saint, he was indeed 
earnest to go on shore, wishing to tread in the

footsteps of the Apostle Paul. Hut when a ^H 



IGNATIUS. II' )• -OB 

in this, the ship being driven forward, he bless- 
ed the love of the brethren in that place, and 
so sailed by. Therefore in one day and night, 
after having enjoyed favourable gales in the 
same manner, we were led away unwillingly 
on our part, groaning at the separation which 
was shortly to be made of the righteous man 
from us^. But on his part, who was earnest 
to retire quickly from the world, that he 
might come before the Lord whom he loved, 
it happened according to his wish. Having 
therefore sailed into the Roman ports, when 
the impure spectacles were on the point of 
being closed, the soldiers were grieved at 
being so late, but the bishop cheerfully obeyed 
their hastening him forward. 

VI. From thence therefore when they had 
pushed forward, viz. from what they called 
the Port } (for the news respecting the holy 
martyr had already been spread abroad ;) we 
meet the brethren filled with fear and joy; on 
the one hand, rejoicing at what they counted 
the good fortune of Theophorus : on the other 
hand, however, fearing because such a man 
was led to death. And some, who in quiet 
were zealous and speaking in order to appease 
the people, that they should not desire the 



SV MARTTRDOM OP 

death of the righteous man, he addressed 
wfa«n he had iramediately perceived it in the 
spirit : and when he had saluted them all, and 
bad be^ed from tbera the true love, aod had 
reasoned with them more than in his epistle^ 
and hud persuaded them not to envy him 
hastening to his Lord ; (so all the brethren 
kneeling do^vn) and had invoked the son of 
God for the churches, for a cessation from 
the persecution, for the love of the hretbren 
towards one another, lie weis led away witil 
haste into the Amphitheatre. 

And then he was immediately thromi in 
according to the previous command of CEesar^ 
when the spectacles were on the point of 
closing: (for it was a solemn day, as they 
considered, called in the Roman tongue Ter- 
tiadecima, on which they made a point of 
assembling together :) thus he was cast to 
cruel beasts hy the temple, so that the desire 
of the holy Martyr Ignatius was presently 
fulfilled : as it is written, " the desire of the 
righteous shall he granted ;" that he might 
be burdensome to none of the brethren by 
the gathering of his relics, as he had pre- 
viously in his epistle b«sought, that it might 
so come to pass at his own consummation. 
For only the harder of his holy relics were

VIL Now these things were done on the 
thirteenth of the Calends of January, (that 
is, the twentieth of December) when Syra^. 
andSenecius the second time^ were the Roman 
consuls. After we had been with tears eye- 
witnesses of these things, and were passing 
the night at our lodgmgs, and beseeching the 
Lord much with kneeling and prayer to 
establish us, dejected at what had just taken 
place^ having dropped asleep a little while,,

I. The church of God which dwelleth as it 
stranger at Smyrna, to the church of God, 
which dwelleth as a stranger at Philad^phia : 
and to all the transitory dwellings (parishes) 
of the holy and intire (catholic) church in 
every place, mercy, peace and love from God 
the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ be 
multiplied. 

We have written to you, brethren, respeot- 
hig those, who have borne witness, (suffered 



9t MABTYRDOH or 

martyrdom,) and the blessed Polycarp, whv 
aisuaged the persecutioD, having sealed it» 
as it were, by his testimony (Martyrdom.) 
For almost all the foregoing events have 
fallen out, that the Lord from above might 
demonstrate unto us the martyrdom accord- 
ing to his gospel. For he waited that he 
might be delivered up, as also the Lord, that 
we too should become his followers : not 
only regarding ourselves, but our neighbours 
likewise : it is the work of true and strong 
love, not only to desire that one's-self should 
be saved, but also all the brethren. 

11. Blessed then in truth and noble are all 
the martyrdoms, which are accomplished 
according to the will of God :^ we certainly 
ought reverently to attribute to God the 
power over all things : for who would not 
have admired their valour and patience, and 
love of their Lord ? who, when tliey had 
indeed been torn with scourges, so that the 
frame of their body was laid open even to the 
inward veins and arteries, yet endured : that 
even the by-standers became compassionate 
and lamented them. But to such a degree 
of fortitude did they reach, that not one of 
themselves flinched, nor groaned : giving 
proof to all of us, that the martyrs of Obriet 



4 




in that hour, in which they were tormented, 
were abroad from the body ; yea, rather, that 
the Lord stood by, and conversed with them : 
and giving heed to the charity of Christ, they 
despised the torments of the world, by one 
hour being redeemed from eternal punish- 
ment ; and the fire of their cruel tormentors 
was cold to them. For they had before their 
eyes the escaping from fire everlasting, and 
which is never quenched, and they beheld 
with the eyes of their heart the good things 
which are laid up for them that endure, which 
neither ear hatb heard, nor eye hath seen, 
nor hath it entered into the heart of man to 
conceive, but wAtcA were disclosed unto them 
by the Lord; who were no longer men, but 
already angels. And in like manner also 
those condemned to the wUd beasts suffered 
cruel punishments, being forced to lie upon 
sharp instruments, and bufietted with various 
other torments, that, if it were possible, the 
tyrant through continued puuishment might 
turn them to a denial. / 

III. For the devil invented many things 
against them, but thanks be to God, he did 
not prevail against all. For the most noble 
Germanicus, by the patience that was in him, 
strengthened their timidity: who in an ilius- 



W MAETVBDOM OF 

trioas manner fought with the wild beasts. 
For when the Pro-consul wished to persuade 
him, and to tell him to take pity on his' age, 
he drew the wild beast by force unto him, 
wishing to be removed more quickly from 
their unjust and wicked life. And thenceforth 
all the multitude wondering at the nobleness 
of the godly and pious race of the Christians, 
cried out : take away the Atheists,^ let Pbly- 
carp be sought. 

IV. But a person named Quintus, a Phry- 
gianj who had newly come from Phrygia, 
when he saw the wild beasts, was a&atd. 
Now this man was he that forced both htmself, 
and certain others, to come of their own 
accord. Him the Pro-consul, after he had 
besought him with much perseverance, per- 
suaded to swear and to sa<!rifice. For this 
cause then, we praise not those, who come of 
themselves, since the gospel does not so teach. 



V. But the most admirable Polycarp, on 
his part when he first heard, was not troubled, 
but wished to remain in the city: however, 
the greater part persuaded him to retire : and 
be retired to a small house in the country 
not far from the city, and with a few passed 
dfty and night, doing nothing but praying for 




I 



ijl men» and for the churches throughout tlM 
world: which was usual with him« And 
while he prayed he saw a vision three days 
before his apprehension. And he saw his 
pillow ^urnt by fire : and he turned and said 
prophetically to those that were with him : I 
must be burnt alive. 

Vl. And while they persevered in seeking 
him, he removed to another small country- 
house, and immediately those that sought 
him came : and when they found him not^ 
they apprehended two boys, one of whom^ 
when put to the torture, confessed* For it 
was impossible that he should be concealed^ 
since even those that betrayed him were his 
domestics^ And the peace^fficer, also called 
Kleronomus, whose name was Herod, hastened 
to bring him into the stadium ; that he indeed 
might finish his own course, being made a 
partaker of Christ : but that his betrayers 
might sustain the punishment of Judas him- 
self. 



r 



Vil. His persecutors and horsemen then 
took the little boy, at the hour of the prepa-^ 
ration for supper, and went out with their 
customary arms, as if chasing a robber. And 
at a late hour they came and found him in 9^ 

o 



96 MAlfcTTRDOM OF 

certain smaU house^ lying in an upper room t 
and from thence he could have departed into 
another place, but he would not, saying, the 
will of the Lord be done. Therefore when 
he heard of their arrival, he came down and 
conversed with them ; and some of the people 
present, wondering at his age and firmness^ 
said : what occasion was there for such great 
speed to apprehend such a venersdl>le man? 
Straightway then he gave orders to set before 
ihem, to eat and to drink, in that hour, as 
much as they would : and he besought of them, 
that they would give him an hour to pray, 
without restraint. And when they had per«- 
mitted him, he stood and prayed, being full 
of the grace of Grod, so that he could not 
cease for two hours ; and those who heard 
him were astonished, and many repented that 
they had come against such a divine old 
man. 

VIIL Now when he had ended his prayer^ 
having made mention of all whom he had 
ever met, both small and great, both noble 
and obscure, and all the Catholic church 
throughout the world, the hour of departiire 
being come, they set him on an ass, and con- 
ducted him into the city, it being the great 
•iabbath : and there met him the peaceH>fficer, 



POLY CARP. »» 

Herod, and his father, Nicetes, in a chariot, 
who also removed him into the chariot, and 
sitting by Aim, persuaded liim, saying: Why, 
what evil is it to say. Lord Csesar, and to 
sacrifice, and such like, and to be saved? 
But he at first made them no answer : but 
when they persevered, he said, I will not do 
what you advise me. So when they had been 
disappointed in persuading him, they spake 
fierce words to him, and speedily overturned 
him &om the chariot ; so that his thigh was 
injured in the fall. And without turning 
round, as if he had suffered nothing, he pro- 
ceeded with alacrity and speed, being con- 
ducted to the stadium. Now the tumult in 
the stadium was so great, that no one could 
even be heard. 

IX. But as Polyearp was entering the list, 
there came a voice fi-oiii heaven : " Be strong, 
Polyearp, and quit thyself like a man." Now 
him that spake certainly no one saw, but the 
voice, those of us who were present, heard. 
And when he had arrived there was a great 
tumult, as soon as they heard that Polyearp 
was taken. At length, now that he was 
brought, the pro-consul asked him, if he was 
Polyearp; and having confessed, the other 
persuaded him to deny, saying, " Have 



B'lTRnOM OP 



regard to thine age : and other things accom- 
panying them :" as was their custom, saying, 
"Swear by the tbrtuoe of Caesar — repent;" 
say, " Take away the atheists." But Polycarp, 
when he had looked with a serious counte- 
nance upon all the multitude of the wicked 
Gentiles in the list, and had shaken his hand 
at them, having both groaned and looked up 
towards heaven, said, " Take away the 
atheists." The pro^consul still persisting, 
and saying, " Swear, and I will release thee; 
reproach Christ;" Polycarp said, "Eighty 
and six years have I served him, and he has 
in nothing injured me : how then can I bias* 
pheme my king, who has saved me?" 

X. But white the other persisted again, and 
said, " Swear by the fortune of Caesar," he 
answered, " If thou vainly desirest that I 
should swear by the fortune of Caesar, (as 
thou sayest), and pretendest to he ignorant of 
me, who 1 am ; with freedom hear, I am a 
Christian. But if thou desirest to learn the 
word of Christianity, appoint a day, and 
hear." The pro-consul said, " Persuade the 
people." But Polycarp said, " Thee, indeed, 
counted worthy even of a reason. For we 
have been taught to pay to Governments and 
Powers ordained of God, due honor, without 



^^1 have beei 
^^^ Powers o 



I

iojuring ourselves ; but them I do not count 
irorth;, that I should make a defence unto 
them." 

XL Then the pro-eonsul said unto him, 
** I have wild beasts ; I will cast thee to them 
unless thou repent." But he said, " Call for 
them ; for a change frona better to worse is to 
us impossible. But it is a good thing for me to 
be changed from wickedness to righteousness." 
The other said again to him, " Thou shalt be 
consumed by fire, (if thou despisest the wild 
beasts) unless thou repent." Polycarp replied, 
** Thou threatenest me with fire, which burn- 
eth for an hour, and is soon quenched. For 
thou art ignorant of the fire of the future 
judgment and eternal punishment which is 
reserved for the ungodly. But why delayest 
thou ? bring what thou wilt." 

Xn. Now while he spake these things and 
many more, he was replenished with courage 
and gladness, and his countenance was filled 
with charity, so that he not only did not give 
way, from being confused at tlie words, which 
were spoken unto him, but that, on the con- 
trary, the pro-consul was amazed, and sent 
his herald to proclaim three times, in the 
middle of the stadium, " Polycarp has con- 



110 MARTIRUUM OF 

fessed himself to be a Christian." This having 
been spoken by the herald, all the multitude, 
both of Gentiles and Jews, that dwell at 
Smyrna, with unrestrained rage, and with a 
loud voice, cried out, " This man is the 
teacher of ungodliness, the father of the 
Christians, the overthrower of our Gods, that 
teacheth many not to sacrifice, nor even to 
worship the Gods." AVhen they had said these 
things, they cried out, and asked the Asiarch 
Philip to let a lion loose upon Polycarp. But 
Philip said, that it was not lawful for hhn, 
because the sports of the wild beasts were 
ended. Then they deemed it proper to cry 
out, with one accord, that Polycarp should be 
burnt. For it behoved the vision to be ful- 
filled which was shewn to him on his cushion ; 
when, having seen it on fire, while he was 
praying, he turned and said to the faithful 
who were with him, prophetically, I must be 
burnt alive. 

Xlll. These things therefore were no sooner 
said, than done ; because the multitudes 
immediately gathered together wood and fuel, 
both from their workshops and baths : espe- 
cially the Jews, who applied to this work 
with alacrity, as was their custom. And 
when the pile was prepared, having put off

aforetime he had not to do, because every 
one of the believers was always zealous, who 
Nhould first touch his person : for even before 
his martyrdom, by reason of his good govern- 
ment, he had been adorned with every excel- 
lence. Immediately then, the instruments 
fitted for the pile were put about him. And 
when they were about to nail him also, be 
said, " Leave me so. For He who has 
granted unto me to endure the fire, will grant 
me also, without your security of nails, to 
remain unshaken in the pile." 

XIV. 80 they nailed him not, but bound 
him. And when he had put his hands behind, 
and was tied, as a noble ram from a large 
flock for an offering, an acceptable burnt- 
offering prepared for God, having looked up 
towards heaven, he said : " O Lord God 
Almighty, the Father of thy beloved and 
blessed Son Jesus Christ, by whom we hare 
received the knowledge of thee, the God of 
angels and powers, and of the whole creation, 
and of all the race of the righteous, who live 
in thy presence: I bless thee, that thou hast 
counted me worthy of this day and hour, 
that I should receive a part in the number of

thy martyrs, in the cup of thy Christ, ifl 
order to the resurrection of the life everlast- 
ing, both of soul and body in the incorruption 
of the Holy Ghost: among whom may I be 
received before thee this (lay, in a sacrifice 
fat and acceptable,as thuu hast afore prepared) 
and foreshewn and fulfilled, the God that is 
true, and that cannot lie. Therefore also for 
all things 1 praise thee, I bless thee, I glorify 
thee, with the everlasting and heavenly Jesus 
Christ, tfay beloved son : with whom, to 
thee, and the Holy Ghost, be glory, both now 
and for ever. Amen. 

XV. And when he had uttered the Amen, 
and completed the prayer, the firemen lighted 
the ftre. And as soon as a great flame had 
blazed up, we, to whom it was given to see* 
saw a great wonder: who also have been 
reserved in order to declare, what thing* were 
done, unto others. For the fire having taken 
the form of an arch, like the sail of a ship 
filled with the wind, encircled, as with a wall, 
the body of the martyr. And it was in the 
midst, not as burning flesh, but as bread 
baked, or as gold and silver burning in a 
furnace ; we also received so sweet a fra- 
grance as of fresh frankincence, or of some 
other of the precious spices.

XVI. Finally, therefore, when the wicked 
saw, that his body could oot be consumed by 
the fire, they ordered the executioner to 
approach, and thrust a dagger into him. And 
as soon as he had done this, there came forth 
with his spirit,^" such a prodigious quantity 
of blood, as to extinguish the fire, and asto- 
nish the whole multitude, that there should 
be any such great difference, between the 
unbeliev^ers and the elect, one of whom was 
even this most admirable Martyr Polycarp, 
made in our times an apostolic and prophetic 
teacher, and bishop of the Catholic church in 
Smyrna. For every word, which went forth 
from his mouth, both has been, and shall be 
accomplished. 

XVII. Then the invidious and malignant 
and wicked adversary of the race of the 
righteous, when he saw both the greatness of 
his testimony, and his blameless conduct from 
the beginning, and that he was crowned with 
the crown of Incorniption and that the re- 
ward of victory was triumphantly borne off, 
bestirred himself, that not even a relic of him 
should be received by us, although many 
o/"m* had a strong desire to do this, and to 
partake of his holy remains. Therefore he 
suborned Nicetes, the Father of Herod, and 




brother of Alee, to prevail with tiie Magis- 
trate, that his body should not be glreu 
for burial ; lest, says he, they should leave 
him, that was crucified^ and begin to 
worship this man. And in saying these 
things, they were prompted and strengthened 
by the Jews, who also kept guard, while we 
were about to receive him irom the fire; 
being ignorant that we shall neither ever be 
able to forsalte Christ, who suffered for the 
salvation of the whole world of the saved, 
(the spotless for sinners) nor to worship any 
other. For him indeed, being the Son of 
God, we do worship ; but the martyrs, as 
disciples and followers of the Lord, we 
worthily love, because of their unconquer^ 
able good-will towards their own Iting and 
master, witli whom, may it be granted unto 
us also, to be made partakers and fellow- 
disciplea. 



XVIII. When, therefore, the centurion saw 
the contention that was made by the Jews, 
he put him In the middle of the fire, and 
burned him. And so we afterwards gathered 
up his bones, (more valuable than precious 
stones, and tried above gold), and deposited 
t^em in a convenient place. There, as It shall 
be in our power^sflembled together in joy

and gladness, the Lord will allow us to keep 
the anniversary of his martyrdom, both in 
remembrance of those who have wrestled, as 
well aa for the exercise and preparation of 
these who shall hereafter. 

XIX. Such were^ the factg relating to the 
blessed Polycarp, who, together with the 
brethren from Philadelphia, waa the twelfth 
that bore witness in Smyrna, and is alone 
made mention of by all ; so that even by the 
Gentiles in every place he is spoken of; being 
made not only an illustrious teacher, but also 
an excellent martyr; whose martyrdom all 
covet to Imitate, seeing it was conducted 
according to the Gospel of Christ, For by 
patience he strove against the unjust magis- 
trate, and so received the crown of incor- 
ruption ; and exulting with the apostles and all 
the righteouB, he glorifleth God and the Father, 
and blesseth our Ijord, both governor of our 
bodies, and Shepherd of the Catholic church 
throughout the world. 

XX. Ye therefore on your part deemed it 
worthy, that, what was done, should at lai^e 
be declared unto you. But we for the present 
have made you acquainted with it, in a sum- 
mary by oar brother M i^l_ Then when y<m

have informed yourselves of these things, 
send the epistle also to the brethren beyond 
you ; that they likewise may glorify the 
Lord, who maketh selections from his own 
servants ; who is able by his charity and free 
gift to lead us all into his everlasting kingdom, 
by his son tlie only-begotten Jesus Christ : 
to whom be glory, honor, might, majesty for 
ever and ever. Amen. Salute all the saints- 
Our friends salute you : and Evarestus, the 
writer of this, with all his house. 

XXI. The blessed Polyearp bears witness 
(suffered martyrdom) on the second of the 
present month Xanthicus, the seventh of the 
Calends of May, on the great Sabbath, at the 
eighth hour. He was apprehended by Herod, 
Philip of Tralles being High-priest, and 
StatiuB Quadratus pro-consul, but Jesus 
Christ reigning for ever : to whom be glory, 
honor, majesty, an eternal throne, from 
generation to generation. Amen. 

XXU. We pray you to be strong, brethren, 
walking in the word according to the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to God, 
and the Father and the Holy Ghost, for the 
salvation of the saints elect. As the blessed 
Polyearp hath testified, in whose footsteps in

And again I, Pionius, wrote from the fore- 
mentionedy when I had searched it out accord-

unto me : as I will shew in the sequel : having 
collected it, now almost worn out by time ; 
that the Lord Jesus Christ may gather me 
also with his elect, to whom be glory with 
the Father, and the Holy Ghost, for ever and

It cannot be excusM : it is a wrong 

Proceeding from a too> too partial tongne. 

To say, the prolfer'd service of false Rome 

Had no good savoar, and did never come 

To the gates of Heaven ; fie ! poor Rome^t belied. 

For when our Troops of glorious Martpn died, 

In that warm age, who were their PrieMtt? By whom 

Was their blood shed ? Was't not by holy Rome ? 

Such sweet perfumee, I dare be bold to say, 

Rome never burnt before, nor since that day : 

A sweeter incense, save his dying Son, 

Heaven ne^er accepted since this world begun.

Polycarp rejoices at the long continuabce of frmtfiibKM 
amoDg the Philippians^ it being now nearly fifty jmn siaot 
the date of Fbul's Epistle to them. That it is in truth tht 
fete of every institution to foil away from its original piirit|r» 
or from the original intention of the founder^ all nature and 
history afford ample demonstration : which decaying prin- 
ciple is forcibly typical of the final dissolution of all things^— ^ 
the earth itself. 

And nothing experiences degeneracy more quickly than 
churches. Convincing proofs of this abound both in the 
Old and New Testaments. If we look at the epistles to 
the seven churches, (Rev. ii. and ML) we shall find that

Ftul's predictioD (Acts xx. 99, SO.) was in pttt folfilled ; and 
that too before the deatk of tbe ilpofitle John, who resided in 
those parts in his latter days. For tiuB Terr church is 
threatened with the removal of the ca u d U s iiek ami cf his 
place. The chordi of QaidisBi wma already, with the ezeep- 
tion of a few names, become a mere nominal church : thorn 
hast a matme that thorn Iwest, amd art dead. As for that of the 
Laodioeans, it was become ao naoseous nnio the RBMCBMn, 
that he says to it : / wiU spue thee out of wuf mouth. 

The Smymaean^ which was comparatiTdy a newly estab- 
lished chareh, for this Epistle of Polycarp informs ns that it 
did not exist in the days of i^uil, and the Fhiladdphtan, are 
the only two of the seven, that receire unqualified com- 
mendation. 

Now let us turn to the Old Testament, and take a view 
of the chureh in the prophetic age. If ever there was a 
man that laboured most ioda£Ba^;ably to give stability and 
diuation to his instkntions, M osea was that man. How long 
then did their influence prevail with the people ? Amd the 
people served the Loan all the datfs rf Joshua, amd aU the days 
ofikB tMtn, that ouHsoed Joshua, who had seem all the groat 
works oftheJjORD, that he did for IsraeL (Judges iL 7.) We 
maf wdl eidaim^ and was that all } That waa all : for 
tttre arM'amoiher generation tfier ihem, which kmew noi the 
1jORl^0mr yet the works, which he had dome fir IsraeL (v. 10.) 
jAtf whim the Loan raised them up Judges, them the Loan was 
wHh the Judge, and delivered ihem out of the hand of their 
enemies all the days of the Judge: (v. 18.) And ii oasme 
to pass when the Judge was dead, that they returned and eor^ 
rupted themselves more than their fathers, in foUomimg other 
gods to serve them, and to how down unto them : they ceased 
not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. (v. 19.) 
And thus they went on- from time to time, till they slew the 
Loan of Life : and Afeil their measure was filled up : and

into the outward church even io his day. And certun it i> 
that every century iidded most lurgely (o their Dumber. 

A very different gos|>el then, the Missionaries of I'ope 
Uregory brought into England, from that gospel, which llie 
Ajioatles had preached. Still greater was the deviation from 
the TRUTH in the days of Alfred. But aa to the Romish 
worship of tlie present day, no sober-minded man, who 
takes a view of it, and then reads the New Testament, can 
say there is the least resemblance between the two. But 
before we proceed further, let us hear Auguiiline. " I cannot 
approve the neic practices introduced ahuost with a> much 
solemnity aa Mcramtnti; neither dare I censure them loo 
freely, lest I !>hou1d give offence to any one ; but it grimes tue 
that BO many salutary precepls of scripture should be held 
cheap, while our religion abounds with commandments of mere 
men." Augustine's Epistle to Januarius : Miloer's Cburdt 
History, vol. ii, p. 469. 

If precepts oj scripture were held cheap in the church j and 
if commandments of men abounded, how grievous was the 
departure trom the gospel so long as two liundred years before 
the Saxons of this island received Christianity ! 

I shall shew presently what a. corrupted faith was Pope 
Gregory's ; but must be allowed first to digress for a few 
moments, to expose the inconsisteucy of Mr. C. Butlerj the 
opponent of the ' Book of the Church.' This gentleman, 
while he abuses Martin Luther with the utmost malignity, 
spares not to bestow upon Augustine the praise that he 
merits ; and strongly recommends his ' Confessions' to 
Southey's perusol. Now that Luther and Augustine were of 
of one spirit, is perfectly clear to every man of true discern- 
ment. There was not a shadow of difference in the essential 
points of the divinity of these two illustrious preachers. 
But it fell to Luther's lot to live in a day, when the enormities 
of the Pope and his agents !□ their ' sales of indulgenc 
were utterly beyond the endurance of any man of thuth. 




ArPSKDIX I. 117 

On the other band« it fell to the lot of Augustine to live 
before Antichrist had sufficiently grown up, to exercise his 
odious po^er and dominion over the visible churches of the 
West. They differed no more than the prophets and apostles 
diffeied, who were oi one spirit The prophets embraced 
CHRIST in prospect: the apostles embraced him in the real 
personal enjoyment of him. So Augustine abhorred the 
power of Antichrist in prospect : Luther was made to abhor 
it^ from feeling it in reality unmerclfiilly exercised towards 
him. 

Butler even quarrels with Luther for ' laying aside the 
study of the world and the flesh' : (see the Ordering of Priests) 
an injunction which is laid upon all of us : in Uie same 
breath praising Melancthon for his apostacy. Take his own 
words out of p. 1B2 of his 'book of the Roman Catholic 
church.* 

'' It is observable that ' Luther and Melancthon,' to use 
Hie words ofMosheim, ' seemed to set out with a resolution to 
banish every species of phik)sophyfrom the church/ " &c.&c. 

'' I see no reason to suppose, that Luther changed the 
c^inion expressed in the passage which I have cited : 
Melancthon eertainly did, and published his Lod etenmunes, 
a philosophieal toork, greatly esteemed.** 

Now parallel to this, in the words of Milner/ behold the 
sentiments of Augustine. . <if. . 

" lU' reply to Dio8eorus> be (Augustine) justly guaids him 
against the ctiriour and. presumpiwms spirit of philosophixki^^ 
and dares to pronounce, in opposition to Clemens Alexan- 
drinus, Origen^ and seveml others of the fhthars, tiiat 
Christian piety needs not the assistance of secular instrucUon, 
but ought to depend solely on the scriptures, and he cautions 
his friend against the pride of secular learning,"' &c. &c — 
(Milner, vol. ii. p. 460.) 

Where, then, is the difference between these two servants 
ci Cbbist > But it belongs to the Wnd to praise the one.

And it would be still easier to demonstrate the further 
departure of the Roman church fipom the precepts, of scripture> 
IB. enecy century dowd.tp the present time: but that would 
fill a large volume^ aod could not be done in a small appendix

to live according tp the scriptures. And, to be brief, the 
Romanists, it seems, hay.e .long sinpe felt sjacb impossibility ; 
aeeing ihat^ for ages past, they, like the Jews, have wholly 
turned aside to their traditions ^ i^d to practise such abomi- 
nations as are even unheard of in the Pagan. world : so that, 
in truth, they have corrupted ihemselvei moreihan their fathers, 
in foUou^ other go<ts to serve them, and to bow down unto 
them. The Jews publish to the world, that their Talmud 
(book of traditions) is more to be regarded than the writings 
of Moses. Do not the Romaniat^ the very same } And with 
all this before his eyes, the author of the ' Pioteatant Reform- 
ation* pours torrents of abuse upon the former people (the 
Jews), while, with the most unsparing benefio6nce» heiieaps 
up adulation upon the latter people. 

Does he imagine, we are prepared to believe, that every 
blessing, which this land enjoyed before the Reformation, was 



120 APFBHPIX I. 

c»wiDg to the Roman religion ^ and thai every evil, which H 
has felt since that event, is owing to the Protestant religion } 
That England was great and glorioos before tiie Befonnation 
is an nndoabted truth : bat that her greatness demonstmted 
tiie excellency of the Romish religion^ Is as certainly fidse* 
Upon as good gronnds might we say, that the thonsands of 
idcds adored by pagan Rome were the cause of att her ^ory, 
greatness, and durability. Was it the chained Apollo of Tyre 
that enabled her to detain before her walls, for seven months, 
tiie all^weeping army of the invincible Macedonian? 
(Curtius^ lib. iv. cap. 3 & 4. The bmve Tyrians during the 
mege chained his Godship, lest he should escape and witln 
draw his protection from them.) Was it the rdigion } or the 
dvil institutions of Lacedaemon and Athens, that made those 
small states more than a match for the whole Persian empire? 
Cyrus, the elder, was the greatest of conquerors ; yet the true 
worship, the Lord tells us, he knew nothing o£l — ^Isa. xlv« 4. 
Again, we read that the Assyrian empire, which was the 
most andent, was also the most durable of all other empires j 
it having governed Asia for 1300 years (Prideaux). Was her 
glory all owing to her idolatrous religion ? Oh ! no. No 
more was England's glory and greatness owing, in the least 
degree, to the idolatrous and superstitious abominations of 
which she was guilty, while she submitted to the sway of the 
potentate of Rome. To other causes, then, her greatness is 
to be traced ', and not to that of a traditionary religion : for 
during the very period of England's greatness, the Roman 
Catholic worship equally flourished in other nations, which 
were ground to the dust by unfeeling tyranny and oppression. 
As to his tracing all the calamitous events of modem times 
to the Reformation, he ought In truth to have gone one step 
farther back, and he would have refuted his own work. The 
Reformation most assuredly sprung out of the Intolerable 
grievances, and unspeakable iniquities, and barbarian cruelties 
of the church of Rome. That infinitely just God, of whom

is taken by the Redbembr of mere saying 5 but the esfenfi^ 
of Christianity lies in doing and keeping. Let us not love

This is again a most beautiful passegej shewing the wide 
•distinction between the believer and the unbeliever. To set 
inaclter point of view that ' lluth Cannot do the things of 
uAbdief^ MT unbdief thfe things Hf &ith)' let us ask the 
questkms : what il i8> that ftith beli^tfes ? and what it is» that

In answer to the second question : unbelief denies^ nay^ 
(as in the case of the wretched Socinian) laughs to scorn the 
very notion of the Cmitor's assuming mi^hobd itttb union 
with him ; being ignorant that it is tat, very far beyond the 
reach of lallen nature ever to attain to such a belief as this : 
which is a blessing given from above to them, that are bom, 
not of biood, nor of the will qf the fieah, nor qf the miU of 
man, htU q^ God, (John i» 13.) Alas ! that scarcely one 
jQalvinist in a thousand ever attain^ a, true feieling, belief of 



1^6 APPHNDIX I. 

this^ is most evident: hoW tlien should a poor blind Sociataa 
attain to it? ' It is utterly impossible^ And Ignatius weU 
sajs, ^unbelief cannot do the things of fiiith.* 

I once heard of a good man, (so called) a minister of th^ 
gospel tboy who never could bring his mind to believe th^ 
the great and omnipotent God, who built the world, coidd 
ever condescend to give to Moses all those minute directions 
respecting the utensils of the tabernacle -, as recorded in the 
writings of that prophet. Oh ! ala»! inconceivably great as 
sbch eondescetDsion undoulytedly iss yet how many, times 
deeper mtist this jgood' man*8 faith « goy : before he . .attains to 
that, which wiU stand him in any stead at the day (tf . judgr

'Ibbir religion is iiothingmore>. than awhim of the brain, 
ednceived, and hatched, and nounshed there by the /Prinoe 
of Darkness/ under whose influence alone they, wholly act. 
But the feeling sense of this great mystery; that '^God was 
made isin;,' (and nothing else can do. it): takes away all guilt 
as dean out of the conscience as if none had ever been com- 
ikiihed; (Heb. x. 14.) . The prophet Isaiah was, well 
satisfied of the truth of this : Though yomr. mti he «« spablbt,

inconsistent with the scriptures ; and is dearly a corruption

The r&gans^ to be sure, as Celsus for instance, looked upon 
these Heretics to be Christians equally with the Orthodox, or 
True Belieyers. But the real Christians could easily discern 
by the power of the Spirit of Truth, that they had no actual 
existence in Chbist^ no more than our modern manifold 
sects have : though they all call themselves Christians. 

Stronger language against heresies perhaps scarcely ever 
was penned^ (except in the hdy scriptures) than what is 



APPHNDIX I. 133 

contu0dd in the vi. yii. viii. ix. x, and xi. chapters of this 
traly beautiful epistle. Therefore as heresies of ali sorts, no 
less, if possible still more, dangerous exist now, I must in 
this place be allowed a little scope, for the sake of Chbist*s 
flock, whose debtor I am, to defend the pore and unmixed 
Tbutb. 

Having made menticm of Geisus, I {iaye somewhat further 
to say concerning him. He was a bitter writer against 
Chi^istianicy in tibe second ^century : and mudi resembled in 
Uiaftttespect our nodem opponent, W^ Cobbett: some of 
their argumcfnts Mng p^fectly simikr. These arguments 
the reader i^hali have in their own words. And first, for 
i&r. Cobbett : ' aild bere we are" too/* says he, ' with forty 
4»dK5 of iProt6stant religion; instead of the one /o2d, in which 
oUr forefathers lived for nine hundred years; iiere we are, 
divided and splitifpintd 'Sects,* eafehcond^hbg' air ttie t^t

and St. Patrick ^till retnains wliatit was when it- inspired ^e 
heart and sanctified the throne of Alfrbo.' Ph>t. Ref. p. 447. 
•Ncrwfor the-Ejietorcian philosopher, Ceisus: ' Al fii^t, when 
they were but few, they agreed : but v^h^n they became a 
BMidtilude, -tliey were rettt ajgain and again j a;nd each will 
Inve. their own foctions -, for they'had ^tious sjnrits from 
the beginning.* ' They are now so split into different sects^ 
that they^ iiave only the name left them in common.' ' Ye will 
hear them, though diffiering so widely from one another, and 
abusing one another so fouUy^ making that boast.' ''The 
world is crucified unto me, and I to the -wbdd." (Milner, 
v.i. p. 531.) ' V 

Now what languid can be more sfthilar, than that of 
t}iese two enemies, though the last-named was dead nearly 
sixteen hundred yean befove the) other viras bom ? What

fold, io which our forefathers lived for nine hundred years ?^'* 
Is not that ancient doxology herein proved true : '' As it was 
in the beginnings is* now, and shall be, as long as the world 
endureth?*' 

I had nearly forgotten to mention, that Bntler also is weak 
enough to make use of the very same argument. And I 
have found the following note, which was written, in turning 
over his book on ita first appearance. 

If Christians were so split into sects, as Gdsus says, in the 
second century; of which I have no doubt: how stands 
Butler's ai^gument against the Protestants in his reply to 
Southey? Butler, like Celsus, charges them with being 
' rent again and again :' and like Celsus, he is equally puzzled: 
— '' If one sort introduce one doctrine, another another, and 
all join in saying, ' believe if ye would be saved, or depart 5' 
what are they to do, who desire really to be saved? are they 
to determine by the throw of a die? Where are they to- turn 
themselves, or whom to believe V* (Milner, v, i. p. 530.)—- 
But it is evident, Butler's charge militates equally against the 
primitive Church, which he with judicial blindness denomi- 
nates the Roman Catholic Church. 

These interrogatories of Celsus remind me of a young 
man who once accompanied one of the seceders, in a call 
upon Mr, M'Culla. At the conclusion of a long argument, 
the young man, perplexed, said : '* When doctors disagree, 
where must the patient go ?" 

The answer to all such is, that the sheep of Cbbist have 
discernment given them, to know the voice of the true 
shepherd 5 and the rest are blinded. My sheep hear my wkey 
and I know them, and they follow me, A stranger they will 
not follow, but will flee from htm; for they know not the voice 
of strangers, — (John x. 5, 27*) The Seceders were a sect of 
very light clouds (Jude 12, and 2 Pet, ii. 17) that sprung up 
from the poisonous atmosphere of Satan, about the year 1815. 
After being driven about by every^cbafig^of the wind, they

church of professing Christians, as described by Celsus, is 
amply confirmed by history. Eusebiua gives an account 
(Lib, vi, e, 2'2) of a voluminous writer, named Hippolytus, 
one of whose works was enlitled, ' Against all Heresies." 
Their number, in fact, was thirty-two ; and by adding the 
Orthodox Christians, it becomes thirty-three ; which number, 
I imagine, will be found quite equal to that of the present 
heretical day. But Hippolytus ia this had done nothing more 
than what the martyr, Irenseus, had done before him. 

Now let us cast a glance or two into the ' one /old of our 
forefathers,' so emphatically pressed upon our attention in the 
' Protestant Reformation,' and see if all was perfectly undi- 
vided, peaceable, and unanimoua there. ' That which had 
been law during seven reigns' (says this new Doctor of Roman 
Divinity, speaking of Queen Mary's aeta), ' comprising 
nearly lico centuries, and some of which reigns had been 
amongst the most glorious and most happy that England had 
ever known, one of the kings having won the title of King 
of France, and another of them having actually been crowned 
at Paris ; that which had been the law for so long a period, 
was now the law again : so that here was nothing neia at any 
rate.' What ! then the burning of heretics in the reiga of 
Mary had been the practice of nearly two centuri^ ! A pretty 
specimen of the peace and uniformity of the ' one fold.' 

But to handle this matter as briefly as possible : the first 
statute against dissenters was enacted so long ago as the 
reign of Richard II. in the year 1382 ; a hundred and fifty 
years, or thereabouts, ijefore Heury VIII. separated 
from the Pope. It provided that unauthorised preachers and 
their abettors should be arrested and confined, till they were 
willing to plead in the ecclesiastical courts. 

And I believe this was the iirat time, since the conversion 
of the Anglo-Saxons, that any restraint was enjoined upon 



136 AfPSNO0C U 

preaching in England, The Act had been procured by thd 
bishops, who, as Paal says to Timothy, having ' turned away 
their ears from the truth, unto fables,* could no longer bear to 
be disturbed in their easeand luxury. However, as if ashamed 
of what they had done, after a petition made to Parliament 
by Wydiffe, the abOve-mentioned Act was repealed. 

But so exceedingly alarmed for the safety of the d^ureh had 
the clergy and Government become nineteen years afterwards, 
that on the petition of the deigy to the king in Farliiyaaent 
(Henry IV.), an act was passed for the protection of the 
church, and the euppreuum of the new $eetj which pnwided 
that heretics (in other words, dissenters), if Ihey would not 
recant, should be caused ^ to be bpml «a a lugh place befora 
the people,' that such puniahmenlrmight strike tocror into the 
minds of others.' 

In 4Aie year 1388 (M».:6).eiipdtBl piinishmenit wvaxdeinAnded* 
in Pariiament upon* some toffendiog Peers, when the Pww»^^, 
arose, and observed, that in obedienee. ta the eauofts,, which 
forbade the clergy to interfere in jUDCUCSNTt of nfJOOi^t^hA and 

the other prelates should depart ? and aU th^<bi8hop^>

Can it be believed, that, in the short space of thirteen years^ 
the same deliealeTace: should petition for the enao^ment of <it.

racy in this case.ift most striking and rapid. How amaziogy 
then, the effrontery of the nsan who is not. ashamed to assert 
that the Rooum Catholie religion haa. always nesaained the 
same that it was 1900^ years agol Noriahoold XomU ^

yereA the city and temple of Jerusalem^ new dedicated the 
sanctuary^ erected a new altar in il^ and again restored the 
Jewish worship in that place/ (in the year before the burth 
of oar Lord 164) ' they were much moved with envy and 
hatred against them iiereon 5 and therefore taking counsel 
together against them^ resolved to act in concert together for 
their utter extirpation, and began to execute this resolution^ 
by putting all of them to death, who were found sojourning 
any where among them^ purposing to join with Antk>chu8 
for the effecting of all the rest, in the utter destruction of (he 
whole race of Israel* (v. iii. p. 242.) These are some of the 
black features of the type. Certainly it was to be expected, 
that the Antitype would swallow up the type : and it mu^ 
be confessed that he has played his part with amazing per^ 
severance, as will farther appear. For by Hk'ifgents he 
continued in the exertion of his ' whole power and 'diHgence,* 
&c. till at length towards the close of the reign of Henry 
VII., about the beginning of the sixteenth century, ' a cor- 
respondent of Erasmus, (Southey informs us) wrote to him, 
that the price of wood was considerably advanced aboud 
London, in consequence of the quantity required for the 
frequent executions in Smithfield.* Whether wood actually 
advanced in price or not, is more than can be affirmed on 
such authority : but this is evident, that in this ' one-foli 
so unanimous, heretics sprung up faster than they could be 
consumed : or at least what were denominated heretics by 
those fierce Roman tigers, even our own fore&thers. And 
heretics no doubt many of them were, for it hasalwttyd 
happened in times of severe persecution, that both heretics 
and hypocrites have shared the same fate with the true dis- 
ciples of the adorable Immanubl; it never being in the 
power of the men ' of this world* to discern between the 
righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God anil 
him that serveth him not. (Mai. iii. 18.) This part of 
43outhey's book is well worthy of deep attention. The most

•iLcessiye cruelty in causing the unhappy recanters to wear 
Ihe faggotj &G. was equal tp^ perhaps exc^ed^ anything 
practised by the unrelenting Pagan persecutors, in theglorious 
days of primitijire Chr]^ttanity. However, the measure of 
Soman Catholic barbarity in this country waf now filled up : 
and the savage Henry VIII. was made the instrument of 
causing it all to recoil with tremendous force upoi^ their own 
heada by the terrible devastation of all the monasteries. 

When those canons were set forth, which forbade the 
deigy to interfere in judgpneots o€ blood, there was still a 
remnant of truth, belonging to the iC^stablished Church. But 
two,centuries had. produced ^Q entire revolution in the minds 
of Englishmen on. tl^s subject-.: and it is with astonishment 
that we hear^ in the reign of Elizabeth, the great luminary of 
the EngliitfjpM'^ Sk Edward Coke, teaching ''that heresy is 
CO ^xiremely and fearfully punished^ because it is a crime not 
against human, but divine Majesty: ,tbat it is a;a infectious 
. leprosy of the soul -, and, must therefore be cut o^,*' &c. (Coke, 
Inst. Ui. 5. Lingard, v. 4.)- Thus this layman could take 
upon him to read- uS: a lecture in divinity, and on a point of 
doctrine alone intelligible by sound divines. What then is 
the divine law on this subject I Paul will resolve us in a very 
few words : A man that i« a fieretic ctfter the-fifst and second 
admQnition reject, (Tit. iii. 10.), There we have the whcde 
law of heresy : and the punishment is simply— rejection. 
And it is for this reasoa that Ignatius says heretics ' exi^t 
only in appearance :* having neither, fellowship with the 
church } nor with the head of the church. (I John J. 3.) 
The crime^ as the liearned Judge justly observes, is 'not 
against human, but divine Majesty :* an,d therefore not 
properly cognizable by the civil power. Foi: whenever the 
civil power haa unflertaken this business, it ha& always made 
the awful mistake of punishing them, whom the Son of .Goi>, 
l^ath purchased at the cost of his own lifej of whom the 
l^piiD of hosts saithj he that toucheth you, toucheth the apglf^

trically opposite to* their voir, faifidel advocate, W. Cobbelt p 
and confirms, in the most positive terms^ the whole of ther 
doctrine which 1 have advaooed in the first note-. 

Only one more chaige of Mr. Cobbett's I beg to acquaints , 
my reader with, and then I have done. Cranmer'a Reform*^ 
ation produced in this country, says he, '* immorality, vice of 
all sorts, enmity and strife inGessant>*' (pw 246.)i I attempt 
not to deny the existence of such crimes f for to the disgrace- 
of mankind, and the provocation of divine anger,, they have 
always existed in a greater or less degree. But it is fidr to 
oppose to this charge a small specimen of the beauty of that 
church which he extols so highly. That illustrious English- 
man, the first Archbishop of Mentz, wrote to implore one of 
our Saxon kings, that of Mereia, " to check the debaucherie* 
and duorders of his kingdom.*' He also wroMto Cuthbert, 
Archbishop of Canterbury, desiring him to restndn the womeo- 
of England from going in such numbers to Rome : the 
greatest part of them,** says he, " live in tewdneu, and scan-, 
dalize the church, as there is scarcely a city in Lombardy and 
fVance where there are not some English women of flagUunu 
life and manners** — (Milner, v. iii. p. 183)* What ! and 
pilgrims too, to act thus ! to bring disgrace abroad upon oue 
name and nation ! even pilgrims, who have always been conr 
sidered the purest and sincerest part of that church. And let 
us remember this was above a hundred years before the days 
of Alfred, when the English Roman Catholic Church was in 
its infoncy and comparative purity : yes, and even before the 
invasion and plunder of the Danes, at which period Lingard 
dates its decay. 

The theological part of the ' Pfotestant Reformation' is all 
comprised under these two propositions, viz., I. That the 
Roman Catholic faith still remains what ic was when first 
preached in England by Gregory's missionaries. II. That 
forty sorts of Protestant religion have sprung out of the 
Reformatio^. 



The extmvagance'of the former proposition is folly exposed 
in the first note : and fhe no less folly and ignorance of the 
^latter^ I have now likewise made equally manifest. As for 
'the other parts or subjects treated of in that book^ whether 
^true or Mse, being of a temporal nature, they do not concern 
:4me.-*-With the prophetic lines of Herbert, 1 close this note :

-Of thy great lo?e, once spread, as in an wn 
Doth closet up itself, and still retreat. 
Cold sin still forcing it; till it return.

And as they strive with imconquerable zeal to make others

Jbrth judgment to the Gentiles, In these piMsiigea the sacrvd 
writers have particular reference to his manaood ; for sudi 
an expression as chosen^ or ^lbct^ could not be uttered in 
regard to his Godhead. Peter is veqr clear upon this point 
in the scripture above-quoted : To whom coming as unto a 
Uvii^ STONE. Peter, who knew him well^ would not so call 
him^ if he did not in this place particularly design to point 
out his na«f)hood. Oi>8erve> he says : to whom coming : And 
we well know that our Maker is unapproachable but by man s 
for which cause Paul also says : we- have not a high priest 
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities* 
(Heb. iv. 15.) And again: For there is one God, and 
one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesue* 
(1 Tkn. ii. 5.) But Peter^ desirous of being still ntioce clear» 
adds; 'oH0MN of God:' and then he cites from Isiuah: te- 
hold I lay in Zion a chief comet stone, elect, pxedaus: and 
he thai believeth on him shall not be confounded. 

But by reason of being united into one individual person 
with God, he is> as the prophet anfi the apostle deckirey the 
CHIEF coBNBR STONE. And it is by virtue of this mysfierioUi 
and inseparable union aloae^ that he can with truth be oalfed 
' a SURE FOUNDATION.* Bccause it is impossible to be bo^ 
upon Christj without being built at the same time upon Goi. 
This then being so, what blindness and death does it evince 
to talk of the church's bdng built upon any mere man ! wad. 
to call any mere man a rock, which term is applicable 16 
none but Jehovah. He shall cry unto me Thou art my Faiher, 
my God, and the bock of my salvation. (Ps. Ibxxix. 2&k) 
Sure I am, that had any one been so presumptuous as tooaH 
Peter a rock in his own times, he would have bieen as mudk 
vexed with grief as Paul and Barnabas were, when at Lystra 
the priest of Jupiter would have done sacrifice with tlie 
people unio them. Which when ^ apostles Barnabas and 
Paul heard of, they rent their clothes, .and ran in among 0ve 
people, crying oat and saying, Sirs, why do ye these* things? we

(Acts xiy. 13^ 14, 15.) Origen, a laborious Aleauuidri^ 
writer of the third centnry, and the father of absurdity^ was 
the first, as far as I have read, that conceived the wretched 
idea of the Church's being built upon Peter. Yet even he 
seems to have known better than to suppose that Peter's 
authority rested with the bbhop of Rome. That bishop had 
not arrived at such a pitch of arrogance and impious pre- 
sumption as to set himself over his betters, at least till after 
the days of Ambrose and Augustin, the latter of whom died 
early in the fifth century. Though he might have made some 
attempts, much earlier, to establish his authority, by reason 
of the influence, which his residence in the metropolis of the 
empire naturally afforded him ', yet these attempts had not 
inet with success. Victor, who was bishop at Rome towards 
the close of the second century, seems to have been the first 
who gave any serious manifestations of this thirst for domi* 
nion. For he had the presumption to excommunicate the 
churches of Asia, because they would not, to please his 
whim, alter their long-established mode of celebrating Easter. 
But mark the calm and cool contempt with which Polycrates, 
bishop of Ephesus and Primate of Asia, replied to the 
irritated Roman. " I therefore, brethren, who am sixty- 
five years old in the Lord, and have been conversant with the 
brethren disperst over the world, and have read the whole 
scripture through, am not at all terrified at what I am 
threatened with ; for those, who were greater than I, >have 
isaid : ' we ought to obey God rather than men.* *' (Euseb. 
lib. V. ch. 24.) Victor likewise upon this occasion met with 
sharp reproof from many of the western bishops. 

About fifty years after this a second attempt at dominion 
was made by the then reigning bishop, named Stephen, who, 
as Valesius says, ' was much displeased that heretics should 
be re-baptized without the knowledge of the Church of Rome / 
and in consequence, he sent very sharp letters to the well 



APPfiNIHX i. 147 

known and truly excellent Thascius Cyprian» bishop of Car^ 
thage. The Afncans^ however, as well as many of the 
eastern churches, utterly r^ardless of Stephen's threats, acted 
according to their own viewa upon this subject. 

Having turned aside just to shew that the Roman bishop 
could gain no dominion over the outward church, as long as 
any truth remained in it, I now return to the point which I 
was upon, viz., the foundation of th^ church* Irenseus, a 
servant of Christ in the latter part of the second century^ 
speaks a much more scriptural language than Or^en, whea 
he says, that ' Peter and Paul having founded the church in 
Rome, gave the office of bishop to Linus.* This language 
is consbtent with Paul's. (1 Cor. iii. 10.) According to th$ 
grace of God, which ii given unto me, a$ a wise master buUder, 
I HAVB LAID THE , FOUNDATION, and another buUdeth thereon. 
But let every man take heed, how he buUdeth thereupon. For 

OTHBR FOUNDATION OAN NO MAN LAY, than thot is laid, 

WHICH IS Jssus Christ. According to Irenaeus then, Peter 
was a wise master builder, which he certainly was as well as 
Paul, and that is all that can be said of him with truth. But 
that error on this point may be completely banished, we have^ 
in the above passage from Pa^l, a distinct and positive declar 
ration of what the foundation is -, and that no man caa lay 
ANY othbb. , 

A most blind and ^norant perversion, to be sure, it is of 
the words of the Redeemer, to suppose for a moment that by 
THIS ROCK, he meant his Apostle Peter, when he said : upon 
this rock I will buUd my church.. In order to discuss this 
point dearly, I shall first quote the whole passage : When 
Jesus came into the coast qf Cesarea PhiUppi, he asked his 
disciples saying, whom do men say that I the son qf man am ? 
And they said, some say, that thou art John the Baptist ; som^ 
EUas ; and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith 
unto them, hut whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter 
answered and said, thou art the Christ (anoiniedj the Son of the:

thaU be loosed in heaven. Then charged he his disciples that 
Ithey sfumld tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ, (AsoiBted,) 
<MaU. xvi. 13, &c.) 

Sini6n here in opposition to those, who confessed Jesus to 
be ttictdty one of the prophets, makes a most noble confession 
of Ml GODftBAD : ihou art the anointed, the son of the Umi^ 
God : if then the Soiv of God, he must be eqoally perfect

To make it clear that Simon's confession in this place, was 
tnore particularly of his Godhrad s observe!, that when Jesus 
pats the question to his disciples in the thirteenth verse of 
this chapter, ht calls himself ike saA qf man^ And it is 
evident from the twentieth verse, that he had not yet spoken 
of himself to his disciples, as being more than the son of 
nSOB $ but when he brought forth the confession of his being 
also €^6 awnntiBi, the Son of the living God; and acknow- 
ledged himself so Co be 5 then he laid this chaige on them } 
that they thould tell no num, that he was Jesus the (mointed. 
Which charge was g^ven that this scripture might be fulMed : 
He shall not ertf^ teor Uft np, nor cAnse lUs voice to be heard in 
ihe street, (Csa^ xHiv 3^) Nor indeed do we in any pla<?e read 
of him preaching in any street, like the hardened, indecent

who ure a i^sgraee to their s^ 5 hie always sought nrore 
suitable and retired placets for that work^ But I must keep 
closely to the pointk 

The la&it verse however id «iifllcient to destroy every 
doubt, except where God ha^ given up to hardness of hear^, 
thai *Simon here ootifessed to his Godhtod : Jfff^s^nrulwere4f

\b6 



a'ppsndij: i. 



ever could gain any profitable knowledge of witliout dhkut 
revelattoh^ was the invisible mystery of liia Godhbad. 

That outwani belief, which Christians in general profess to* 
have of the Divinity of Jesus^ without the Father s Hev^r 
tibn, has no root whatever. When the ram, and the floods, 
and the winds come, down it must go. (Mat. vii. 27.) The 
seed of real inward faith is sown in great trial and exercise 
of mind. It is painful work to have the fallow ground of 
the heart broken up, (Jer. iv. 3. and Hos. x. 12,) in order' to 
prepare and make it good, (Mat. xiii. 8 and ^.) True faith 
b sown in trial ; it takes root downward in trial ; it grows 
up in trial ; and in trial its fruit is brought fbrth. When 
Elijah brought forth those glorious fruits of ftdth, ardent love 
to his Redeemer the Orod of Israel, in sla3ring the prophets 
of Baal, and afterwards fleeing for his life, how heavy, how 
exceedingly severe must have been the trial that his soul 
underwent! But this is the faith in Jesus God over all, 
which is revealed not by flesh and blood 5 but by the Father 
which is in heaven, and which no tempest will ever be 
able to eradicate : for he is like a refiner's fire, and Uhe fuller^ $ 
sope $ and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier qfsUoer ; aitd he 
shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and sUner, 
that they may offer unto the Lord an offering tn righteoiianess, 
(Mai. iii. 2, 3.) And by this revelation Simon was BLBSiiBD*; 
that is, restored to that fellowship with his makbb, which* by 
his head and representative Adam he had lost in Eden^ 
Whereas all without such revelation, receive no Uessing ; but 
still remain under the cursb of God, for transgressing his 
most holy law. 

* 

And now follows ^ I say > also unto thee, that thou art a 
'sTONB, and upon this rock I will build my church. The' word 
iPBTROS never signifies a rock ; but a stone ; though the daric 
•Romanists, contrary to all usuage, interpret it, a rockk. I 
'doubt whether the most learned Grecian can produce. one 
'authority for petros haVing been used in the sense of a mck. 



APPENDIX I. l&\

sTONBof the church $ and upon this. rock>. that is^ upon the 
ROCK of 4ny OoDHRAD, of which thou has made. 80> frank and 
noble a confession^ I will build my church. Chrut wdl 
knew^ that, in regard only to his manhood, he himself was 
no rockj much kss conki poor Peter be one. Christ hfm- 
self, well knew, that his created or human heart must be 
broken, and die upon an ignominious cross. It is the nature 
of a rock to be immoveable : . and therefore it is said of 
Jehovah, he is the Rock, his work is perfect. (Deut. xxxii. 4.) 
<But as for poor Peter, he was shaken to pieces, as we ready 
only five verses below. Bujt he turned, and said unto JPeter, 
get. thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me :for thou 
sawmrest not the thiims that be of God, but those that be qf 
me9^ And he was shaken over and over again, many times 
before he arrived at his haven of eternal rest ^ for his Rs- 
OBEMBR told him: Satan hath desired to have you, that he may 
sift, you as wheat. (Luke xxii.Sl.) Yet his 'faith should 
oot fail.' Parkhurst*s observations on the word pbtros are 
•very ridiculous -, he tells us it is used ' for the large stones, 
or rocks thrown up by Mount ^tna j* and also for ' the 
huge stone or rock which Sisyphus was condemned to roll 
up hill.' But neither of these are immovable rocks. Alas I 
alas ! what blindness ! Well convinced I am, that if the 
ROCK upon which the church is built, could be moved either 
by Sisyphus or Mount Mtn&j it must eternally perish. What 
are these shocks } or all the shocks, which the devil coi^ld 
create ? No more than ' as the drop of a bucket,* compared 
-to those heavy and tremendpus shocks, which our glorious 
ROCK had to sustain, before Divine Justice could receive full

extreme. For she is herself the very widest of thos^ gF^S

are spirit, and ihe§ are Lira. But the confining' of these unra 
to Peter is delusion indeed : and nothing proves more* that 
SQch are fast bound Ly them in ' gross darkness-' Did not 
the other apostles have these keys? Ohl yes, they did 
hideed. And in the twentieth chapter of John, we find the 
Redeemer addiessifig the other disciples in words of the very 
same import, as those, which are in the sixteenth of Matthew, 
addressed to Peter : sayii^, whosesoever ms ye rtmii, ikmf 
are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they 
are retained, (v. 23.) He that possesseth the power of 
remitting and retaining sins, possesseth in truth, ih&keys €f 
the kingdom^ of Heaven ; the same, that the apostle Peter 
possessed. For when any man receives jemissioii <^ his sins, 
he that moment enters 'theklngilom of Heaven,* passing 
fh>m death to life : which remission is not received by any 
external word^ or external power ; but by the * word of faitk* 
entering into the soul, and enabling the sinner to .'lay hcdd of 
the NEW COVENANT 5 evcu God in Christ. And herein- hb 
experiences and enjoys the fhlfilmient of Paul's woifds : The 
word is nigh thee, even in thy month, and in thy heart : that » , 
the word ofjaith, which we preach. (Rom. x. S.) The other 
apostles then, it is most evident, were upon an equality with 
Peter in this respect. Yes : and not only the apostles ; but 
every minister of the word oi truth, from that day to this $ 
for without the keys he could be no minister at all ; except 
a minister of darkness. V\'hat then ! are we to believe that 
all the ministers of England, from the noble successor of the 
miracle-working Austin, down to the ignoble successor of 
the truth-denying Wesley, are possessed of ' the keys of the 
kingdom of Heaven ? ' Oh ! no 9 it is not so^ neither : all 
these many thousands are not ministers. There is such a 
thing as having a name to live and being dead. (Rev. iii. 1 ) 
And immense numbers of them, should they read, will find 
themselves bound, by what I now write : happy will it be for 
those, who shall be loosed tliereby.

Those nine epkhets in ^his inscription, beginning at'godty/ 
and ending at 'named after the Paiher,' are ail omftted by 
Simeon Metaphrastes of Constantinople, who was an editor 
of Ignatius in the tenth century. Which makes it doubtful, 
whether they are not an interpolation. 'J'he epithets here are 
certainly in much greater abundance than usual. However, 
as there is nothing, but what might with truth be said' oF 
any church, whose doctrine fs uncorrupted, 1 choose rather 
to let the whole stand according to the Medicean text, than 
to make aji amendnient pn such slight and suspicious autho- 
rity as that of Metaphrastes, the Greek church being no les& 
corrupt than the Latin. 

^^ And may leave nothing of my b^dy, StCi. 

This admirable passage shews very clearly the mind of 
Ignatius with regard to relics, which became such pernicious 
instruments in the hands of Antichrist and his followers in 
after ages. But they having chosen their own ways, God 
hath fulfilled his word upon them : yea, they have chosen 
their own ways, atid their soul drlighteth in t^ir abomin- 
ations. I also will choose their delusions, and will bring 
their fears upon them ;. because when I called, none did answer ; 
when I spake, they did not hear : but they did evil be/ore mine 
eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not. (Isa. Ixvi. 3, 4.) 
And the following passage from a great and most excellent 
preacher at Rome in the third century, fully proves that 
that other abomination, saint adoration, and mediation by 
saints, was then held in just abhorrence, tie is writing 
against the wretched Socinians of his day : '' If Christ isb^.

out continual cavilling atilUie sacred. 'text > which is all that

As for Socinianism and Arianism, they are such heresies, as 
DO Christian can be ih the least danger of filling into : for 
the very first work of the Spirit of Truth, as expressed in 
John xvi. 8, 9 3 fully certifies a sinner, that no Saviour, who 
is less than Almighty, can be of any service to him : fully 
certifies .him> that none but Jehovah can make a sufficient 
atonen»ent$ he therefore rejects with .scpm and contempt 
that false Christ, which the Arian and sSociniMi preachy. and 
presumptuously set up in opposition to the true Redeemer. 
Mr. M'Culla, when speaking of these enemies, always used 
to quote that passage of Peter : these beasts' are made to he 
taken, and de/ttroyed. (^ Pet. ii. 12.) But if theie is no 
danger of falling into such errors, why do you trouble your- 
self tp write against them } I may be fisked. Por this very 
good reason, because the prophet's command is : thou shalt 
speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether 
ihey will forbear, .(Ezek. ii. 7) ,

tFpoD tlie subject of fhe nock, so amply discussed fn <H>m-

passage to the very point. Polycarp's mind, he knew from 
his intimacy with him, was estabUshed on God ; and mark -, — 
*as upon an immoveable rock.* Of which Polycarp gave, no 
doubt, many sure proofs, during the course of his long 
ministry 5 but more signally when he came lo the great and 
last trial of his glorious martyrdom, as it is beautifully set 
forth in the circular epistle of the Smymeaii church. Thus, 
in him the words of the Redeemer were fulfilled : whosoever 
heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken khn 
unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock ; and the 
rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and

heat upon tlhat house ; and it fell not : for it ioas founded 
upon a BOCK. Oh ! yes^ a rock^ in very truth ! well indeed, 
m^t the prophet call it ' a sure foundation ;* adding^ he 
that beUevethsftaU not make haste; thatis^ shall not be thro)tvn 
into eonfusion by any atorm^ knowing his foundation to be 
stron^r than all tempests : for our sock holds them all in 
the hollow of his hand. And then the prophet adds : judg^

ONS ^her mother, ilte choice onb of her thai bare her^ . 

A book, I say in very truth ! Well might the apofitle, 
after a grievous falling away of heretics^ take this co^ola- 
tion to himself : Nevertheless the foundation of God stand* 
eth SVRB ; having this seal : the Lord knoweth them that are 
lus i and let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart 
from iniquity. (2 Tim. ii. 19.) And so PauVs earnestness 
ever was for the proving and establishing of this truth ; as 
he writes to the Corinthians : that your faith should r^ot 
stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. (1 Cor. 
11. 5.) To which agrees the no less zealous^ but, by the 
Romanists, much abused Peter, who says to the strangers 
that they were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver 
and gold, from their vain gonvbbsation^ received by tradi- 
tion from their fathers ; but with the precious blood of 
Christ, &c. -, and sums up the whole passage with these 
admirable words : that your faith and hope might be in God. 
(lPet.i.9l.) 

^ Nor do thou any thing without God. 

The power of that religion, which ruled in the heart of 



1^ APPENDIX I. 

Ignatius, shines forth with a brilliant lustre in this epistle to 
Folycarp : and in these words the enei^y thereof is doubly 
perceptible : ' Nor do thou any thing without God.* Here 
there was no theory> but true practice, according to the 
Redeemer's instructions : Verily, verily, I say unto you, whal^ 
ioever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you, 
(John xvi. SS.) And according also to his beloved apostle 
John> whose disciples both these bishops are said to have 
been :— ^mi this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if 
kt ask any thing aocobdino to bis will, he heareth us ^ 
and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know 
that we have the petitions, that we desired of him. (i John v. 
14, 15.) And all the religion that conies short of thb, is not 
Worth even the name of Religion. For where there is no 
KBY to TBUTH, the TRUTH must bc lockcd up. Ignatius 
«poke to Polycarp, as to one truly possessed of ' the keta of 
Itie kingdom Of heaven.'

This passage I find to have been quoted in the fourteenth 
century^ by the writers agaiqst Wickliff. And doubtless the 
Romanists of the present day will quote it again, as they dq, 
also the scriptures themselves, to their own destruction^ But 
in the name of l£;natius I answer them, in the words ojT 
Chbist to the Jews, whose vi§w of thb subject was as blin(| 
and as carnal, as th^t of their successors in inquity, the 
upholders of the bishop of Rome: — It is the spirifj^ tha^ 
quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words thai I speak 
unto yqu, they are spirit, and they are life. (John vL 63.) 
Igpatiiis was writing against the Docetse, who asserted that 
<^r;st had no real body 5 and therefore could not believe, 
that the Eucharist represented a real body, which is all tha$ 
Ignatius insists upon. For had those forward writers above 
Eluded to, but turned over to the eighth chapter o{ 



164 APPENDIX I. 

the Epistle to ihe Trallians^ they might have scen^ if not 
made blind, what the body and blood of Christ really are to 
Chbistians. Ignatius there writes^ ' build yourselves anew 
in ftiith, which is the flesh of the Lord ; and in love, which 
18 the blood of Jesus Christ.' 

But as it is of great importance to have clear views of this 
doctrine, I shall dwell upon it a little longer. The Roman 
Catholic writer, Mr. C. Butler, chooses to be exceedingly 
chafed at a statement in the ' Book of the Church/ which 
asserts that the popes long hesitated to give their sanction to 
the doctrine of iransubstantialion, ' Nevertheless/ adds 
Southey, ' it prevailed, and was finally declared, by Innocent 
III. at the fourth Lateran Council, to be a tenet necessary to 
salvation/ (Vol. I. ch. x. p. 316.) Which doctrine in plain 
English is this : that the partakers of the Lord's Supper eat 
and drink in a carnal manner the real body and the real 
blood of Jesus Christ. Than which, nothing can be con* 
ceived more horrible 5 nor more savage. We have read of 
cannibals devouring their enemies taken in war ; but I do not 
remember having ever read of any savages, tliat devoured 
their friends. Now Christ is represented to us in the 
sctiptures as far dearer than any common friend, whose 
love even ' passeth knowledge :* but G^d commendeth his love 
towards uSf in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, 
(Rom. V. 8.) To devour the blood of any human creature is 
evvn contrary to natural affection ; much more is it contrary 
to the whole book of God, wl^ich saith : whosoever eateth H 
{even the blood of any manner of beast) sliall he cut off, (Lev. 
xvii. 14.) When God gave to Nosh enery moving thing that 
liveth for meat, (Gen. ix. 3.) he added : But flesh with the 
life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 
And when the Law was given, the priests were commanded 
lb pour out all the blood of their burnt-offerings at the bottom 
/if the altar, (Levit. passim.) 

/4nd whatsoever man there he of the House of Israel or of

lihe Hranger that sojoumeth among you, that eateth any maimer 
of BLOOD > / viill even set my face against that sotU that eateth 
VLOOD, and will cut kim off from among his people. For the 
Vfe of the flesh is in ihe blood ; and I have given it to you upon 
the altar, to make an atonement for your souls : for it is thb 

BLOOD THAT HAKBTB AN ATONEMENT FOR THB SOUL. There^ 

fore I said unto the children of Israel, no soul of tou SBAbL 
EAT BLOOD^ neither shall any stranger that sojoumeth among 
you eat blood. And whatsoever man there be of the children of 
Israel or of the strangers that sojoumeth among you, which 
hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he 
shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust : 
for it is the Ufe of all flesh ; the blood of it is for the l^e 
thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, ye shaU 
£nt the blood of no mannbr of flesh : for the life of all flesh 
is the blood thereof; whosoever eateth it shaU be cut off. 
<Lev. xvii. 10, 11, 12, IS, 14.) We are here also told the 
reason why the prohibition of blood is so emphatically im- 
pressed upon the attention of God*s chosen people : for it is 
Jhe blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. It was 
typical of that most sacred blood, which our Creator took 
into union with him, that he might purchase our redemption 
from our curse, thereby. (Gen. iii. 17, &c.) The very 
thought of the shedding of which makes our breasts to heay^* 
with sorrow and grief. How then could we savagely pour it 
down our throats ? Oh ! alas ! alas ! how different from this 
were the feelings of poor David, who when he was even 
ready to perish with thirst, woukl not drink of the water of 
the well of Bethlehem, but poured it out to the Lord, saying. 
My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing : shall I drink 
the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? 
for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it • therefore 
he would not drink it, (i. Chron. xi. 19.) And so far from 
any alteration in this respect having taken place under the 
gospel dispensation, we have in the sacred records a letter 



166 APPENDIX I. 

from the apostles^ and elders, and brethren, enjoining the 
same praptice on the gentiles who embraced Christianity : 
that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, 
atul from things strangled. (Acts xv. 29.) And this, 
abstaining frqro blood and from things strangled was enjoined 
entirely out of reverence for that sacred blood whkh pur- 
chased the salvation of their souls. And when the martyra 
of Vienne and Lyons, who suffered under the unfeeling Stoic 
Emperor Marcus Aurelius, were charged by their cruel and 
malignant persecutors with devouring Infants, one of tl^em, 
in a burst of holy indignation, exclaimed, '' how is it possible 
for us to devour infants, who are prohibited from eating even, 
the BLOOD of beasts ?" (Ruinart, p. 65.) Surely, then, the 
inhuman notion of the Romanists can have no place in the 
breast, that has been taught to sympathise with the sorrows 
of the most gracious Rsdbbmeb. 

But in truth I firmly believe that were the elements of the 
Eucharist really what the Romanists assert them to be, they 
would, instead of putting them to their mouths, put them far 
from them. I will do them the honor and the justice to say, 
that I do not believe them so utterly destitute of the common 
feelings of humanity, as to suppose that they would actually 
eat the flesh and drink the blood of their dearest friend. In 
•the acts of the martyrdom of Ignatius we have the following 
words : — ' in order to be led away to Home for food for 
blood-devourino beasts :* this remarkable epithet seems to 
me to denote, that the writers of that account conceived it to 
be impossible, that any thing In the shape of man could ever 
be guilty of such enormity. Dr. Lingard, in his work on the 
Anglo-Saxon church, informs us, that inlaying the foundation 
fltone of a new church, the Anglo-Saxons, in case they could 
not procure from the continent approved relics, deposited, 
instead, a portion of the consecrated bread. He also insists 
upon it, that transuUtantiation was the doctrine of that church* 
I ask him then, as a man of sense ' in his generation,* was 



APPENDIX 1. 167 

ihat an honorable mode of treatment for the Rbdeembr's 
Bacred body ? I, for my part, much prefer Joseph of Arima- 
thea^s conduct, when he had that incorruptible body in hia 
possession. But these most iniquitous, most superstitious 
children of darkness, not only craunch it with their teeth, biit 
treat it, as we how treat pieces of coin, by depositing it 
beneath the foundation of a ponderous building. I ask him 
again, would he wish the remains of any one of his relations 
to be so dealt with ? I believe not : I hope not. What, then, 
are all natural relations ? all ties of consanguinity, compared 
with the inseparable union, the unfailing S3^pathy, of the 
head and body of the church } For him it would be our 
delight to forsake^ when needful, every earthly tie : for we are 
members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. (Bph. v. SO.) 
Thy Maker is thine husband. (Isa. liv. 5.) 

It is very ' remarkable, but I find in a petition to Parlia- 
ment made by the Lollards against the Roman Catholic 
Clergy, the following words : '' that they teach transubsiantir 
aiion, which leads to idolatry j enjoin confession, which makes 
them supercilious :'* that the wisdom which dictated those 
sentiments came from above, cannot for a moment be doubted. 
Experience has most amply proved how true they were -, for 
where are there such gross idolators in the world, as the 
believers in transubstantiation ? 

I cannot do better than conclude this long note in the 
admirable lines of the revered Herbert : 

Who knows not love, let him assay 
And taste that juice, which on the cross, a pike 

Did set abroach ; then let him say, 
If ever he did taste the like. 

Love is that liquor, sweet and most divine, 

Which my God feels as blood, but I, as wine. 

2* Wheresoever is Jesus Christ, there is the Catholic Church, 8(C. 
This is a very, very excellent passage, and fully agrees 



168 AFPBNDIX I. 

with what the Rsdsbmrb himself spake. Jnd when he pui" 
teih forth his own sbbbp^ he goeth before them, €nd the sheep 
foUow him, for they know his voice* And a stranger wili» 

THBT NOT FOLLOW^ hut wiU PLBB FBOM HIM ) Jor TEST KNOW 

NOT the voice of strangers. (John x. A, 5.) So that it is not 
possible for any deceiver to deceive his own bhbbp : as he 
•ays again : by their fruits ye shall know them. (Mai. viL 20.) 
Whenever a false shepherd, more commonly called minister^ 
pastor^ or bishop^ makes his appearance among the sheep, 
they ' flee from him/ the Rbdbbmbr says. His voice they 
know not ; because their ears are drcuoMkied* that they can 
hear only what the spirit saith 4o the churches. 

It is «lso clear itom hence^ that in whatever assembly 
Jcsns Christ is not to be founds there is not the Catlu^ 
church. From such congregation, of whatever denoBunatimi, 
the candlestick has been removed -, (Rev. ii. 5.) for Jbsus 
Christ wajucbth in thb midst rf the golden candlesticks, 
(the churches.) (Rev. i. 90.)

mended; it was a weakness from which^ of one kind of 
another, none of us frail mortals are free. Of this there can 
be no question, that they would have much better pleased 
both their friend Ignatius, and his great and divine Master, 
had they decently and carefully interred them in some retired 
spot, before they left Italy. Could the Israelites have found 
out the place where Moses was buried, it is certain that they 
would have 'gone a whoring* after his relics ^ as much as 
ever Englishmen did after those of Thomas a Beckett 5 or 
as they themselves did after the multitudes of their idols, and 
t)f their molten images. (Hosea xiii. 2.) My people ask 
counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them : 
Jar the spirit of whoredoms hath cavsed them to err, and they 
have gone a whoring from under their God, (Hos. iv. 19.) 
What they did with the brazen serpent fully proves the pre- 
ceding assertion. But King Hezekiah^s treatment of that 
serpent is a lesson to us to teach us how to act in all such 
cases. He removed the high places, and brake the images, and 
cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent, 
that Moses had made : for unto those days the children of Israel 
did bum incense to it ; and he called it Nechushtan ; that is, 
brazen, by way of contempt. (2 Kings, xviii. 4.) Thus 
he poured mockery upon their folly, which is the only way in 
which the servants of the Loan can deal with such ignorance, 
snperatition, and wori^ipping and honoring of the devil.

There is a folse zeal in activity also in our d^y 5 of a very

than that aforementioned. I mean the zeal exercised in 
sendmg forth missionaries^ who never had the will of God

and who are walking in total darkness^ while they profess to 
be in the light. The execrable trash which rhey publish in

their najo^eous tracts they make that truth, which is pf all 
things most sabred, a by-word both at home and abroad : 
by the same tracts ptoving themselv/s^ to 1^ o^pre jgnorant of

Mosheim has very deaily-staled why the Primitive Chris-

neither sacrifices, nor temples, nor images, nor pracles, nor

l^ln^in jtl^cr^pcoacbes of .i^n ignorant multitude, who imagined

I COULD have wished to have dosed this book without another

which the truth is much vilified^ and set at defiance \ and 
of which I must not omit to take a brief notice. There are 
no less than three preachers of the Huntingtonian class in 
this single Town of Brighton, each attended by very consi- 
derable numbers, one of whom, (John Gibbs) is the author 
of the book alluded to, from which is taken the following 
extract, p. 83. 

*^ And I sunk in all the sensible pains of hell, so that the 
deep appeared ready to swallow me up, and the pit to shut 



17S 

>ier mouth upon me (Ps. Ixix. 15.) } for I felt myself going 
down to destruction as sensibly as any go from the presence 
of God, when he fAyB, ' ilepart, ye cursed, into everlasting 
burnings;' and the infernal fiend cried out to me, 'tis all 
over with you now.' When in the twinkling of an eye, as 
I thus sunk, thb thought sprang up within me, — ' I will cry 
once more for the litBt time :' and this was the cry : ' Have 
mercy.' At the moment of this misery or anguish passing in 
me, a light opened over my head with such transcendent 
glory that I cannot describe. My reader will please to take 
notice that this took place about midnight, and that the night 
was very dark, and that I did not see the vision with my 
natural eyes. At the instant that this glory opened on tne, 
these words with their contents came with power to my 
soul : — ' The times of refreshing are come from the presence 
of the Lord.' tActs iii. 19.) And these words were also 
ushered in : — ' The Lord whuai you seek, shall suddenly

me, behold me,' (Tsa. Ixv, 1.) and immediately I felt a riiing 
as sensibly as Lazarus did when he came out of the grave, 
and I am certain as sensibly as I shall do when the lust trumpet 
ahall be blown, and my dead body shall arise. O what a sudden 
coming of the Lord was here ! what refreshings ! and what 
a beholding, with wonder and astonishment ! ' what, me. 
Lord*' I cried. 'Yes, thee.' 'But I am unworthy — it 
cannot be — 'tis too great.' I bowed down in myself and 
wondered, and wondered again at so much goodness, till I 
wept aloud, and cried like the prodigul, 'Father, I have 
sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more 
worthy to be called thy son." (Luke xv, 31.) 'I am 
unworthy of so much goodness.' I then went to the window 
to see whether all was real, and whether I was rational, I 
could just see the trees, and perfectly well knew where I 
was, and that I was in my right mind,"

false diTinity^ which this age has produced, I should scarcely 
have considered this man worthy of particular notice above 
the rest^ but for two reasons : firsts he has made a bolder 
attack upon the Truths than any of his predecessors or con-* 
temporaries have had the hardihood to do> making very fr^ 
use of the name of one whom we must ever venerate ; . and 
every insult offered to whose memory, even a common regard 
for divine truth must teach tis to resent with the utmost 
indignation *> Secondly, several persons, who did profess to 
have more understanding, have been drawn into his snare, 
and led in the downward road by his bonabast style of preach- 
ing. This being the case, it behoves us to shew, that we 
hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering : (Heb. 
X. S3.) and though the love of many may wax coldf and 
though concerning faith they may have made shipwreck : 
nevertheless, as Paul testified, the founaation of God standeth 
sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them thai arfi his* 
And, let every one that nameih the name of Christ, depart from 
inuiuity. (^ Tim. li. 19.) Though jthe deceiver io another 
part of his book quotes from Paul to Timothy : for God hath 
not given us the spirit (ffear, but of power, and of love, and 
of a sound mind} yet he was obliged to go 'to the window 
to see if all was real, and if he was rational.' It requires no 
spiritual understanding to know this: ' it must be evident to 
every man possessed of common sense, that if he could not 
discern that he was in his right mind without going to the 
window, he certainly could not dbcern it any better at the 
window. ^ ^ '' 

Indeed, the blessed Immanuel himself and his servants 
have in all ages been called madmen ; but then without any 
ground. In the present instance we have a very different 
case presented to lis | who will say, except such as are in the 
same delusion, that there is not very sufficient ground for the 
charge here?

Catholic power« was William Sawtre. His execution took 
place on the second of March, 1401. Lingard speaks of 
it In the following very a£fected language. " The unhappy 
man, instead of being shut up in an asylum for lunatics, was 
burnt to death as a malefactor in the presence of an immense 
multitude: and the Commons by their speaker returned 
thanks to the king that, whereas by bad doctrine the faith of 
holy church was on the point of being overturned, to the des- 
truction of the king and kingdom, he had made and ordained 
a just remedy to the destruction of such doctrine and the 
pursuers thereof.'* (Vol. iv. p. 447.) I have introduced this 
passage for the purpose of shewing Dr. Lingard and others^ 
the difference between a real lunatic, and one folsely called 
so : and the difference between rash judgment, and judg- 
ment in righteousness : fbr with what judgment ye judge, ye 
ihaU be judged: (Mat vii. 2.) And he that justyieth the 
wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are 
abomination to the Lord. (Pro v. xvii. 15.) Lingard then, 
according to the scriptures, hath committed abomination in 
x^ndemning Sawtre, the just: fbr he hath brought no proof 
against him. So likewise should I be guilty of abomination, 
were I to justify John Gibbs> the wicked; who hath in the 
foregoing extract published quite sufficient to justify any 
medical man in consigning him to such an asylum, as that 
to which Lingard would have consigned Sawtre. 

Sawtre had been, first, rector of Lynn, in Norfolk ; but 
afterwards had been appointed chaplain at St. Osyth's, in 
London. In this situation he petitioned Fftrliament, that he 
might have the liberty of disputing before them. His object 
was to prove to them the corrupt state of the existing 
hierarchy and established clergy in general. So much alarm 
did that pistition create in the minds of the wicked, that he 
was quickly apprehended, and as quickly burnt. And for 
that Lingard, who of course, being a Roman Catholic, must 
make the best of a bad case, affects to pronounce hhn a 
lunatic.

I can only say that^ under similar circumstances^ migbt I 
be blessed witb equal courage. And so far from countings 
bim an unhappy man, be was doubtless most bappy^ for 
bis object was tbe crown of martyrdom 3 and like Igna- 
tius be gained 'bis beart's desire :* and like Timotby and 
Cbrist Jesus^ 'be witnessed a good confession before many 
witnesses/ (1 Tim. vi. 12, 18.) Who, for tbe testimony of 
Jesus, ' was burnt to deatb as a malefactor in tbe presence of 
an immense multitude,* 

As bas been already observed, botb Cbrist himself, and 
bis prophets before him, and bis apostles after him, and bia 
ministering servants to this very day, were not only called^ 
but also counted madmien, by tbe men of this world, ' whicb 
lietb in wickedness :* though they were all possessed, not of 
tbe spirit of superstitious fear ; but ' of power and of love, 
and of a sound mind.' But I warn guilty preachers ; I wara 
the 'wolvea in sheep's clothing,' against sheltering them-' 
selves by saying, when they are buffettedfor their faults, that 
they are only treated like their Master, suffering for Christ'a 
sake. They can never dec^ve us for any length of time - 
we have this unfisuling criterion to judge them hy: by theip 
fruits ye shall know them. 

Having now said more than sufficient to shew what » 
deceived teacher of religion Lewes and Brighten is inf^ted 
with in the character just described, I migbt at once leave 
bim 5 but it may perhaps be more satiisfectory to some minds, 
that I should make a few observations on that part of bis. 
book, which relates to Mr. M'Culla. 

All the transactions there mentioned' took place some yeafs 
before my acquaintance with that noble preacher of the cross 
of Christ b^;an. And though it is saki by those, wha were 
eye-witnesses of the whole, that he has naade a very clipped 
and unfair statement} yet I will not attempt to dispute anj^ 
of the facts witb bim $ but take them all for granted i andl

in order to spare as much as possible mj own and ro j reader's 
time, sliall select tliree particular points for comment : the 
first, shewing his wretched heretical ideas of church-govern- 
ment -, the second, his own avowal that he never embraced 
the truth in heart ; but was all along fyist bound in the strong 
bands of Huntingtonian delusion ; the third, that he is a 
sensualist from first to last, not being able to 'receive the 
things of the Spuit of God/ 

I. ''It was agreed that M'Culla should have no 

contnoul, povirer, pr command over us, or in oridering of any 
thing amongst us, or over the meeting-house, but that all 
order and rule should be in the majority of th6 eleven.*' 
(P. 102.) 

A beautifbl figure of a church is here presented to ns : the 
teacher was then to be under the command and tuition of 
them, whom he taught, One would have Imagined that a 
slight view of the umversal law of nature, anid of common 
sense, would have kept this wonderful preacher from making; 
such an exposure oif his confused mind. But he observes, 
they ' set sail on a stormy opean,' How could it be other- 
wise, when all the scholars were appointed to the command 
over their master ? Paul says to the Hebrews*— /{tfm^mfter 
them th^i bear rule over you, 8(C. And to Timothy he says : 
a biihop must be cne that ruleih weU hie own home, having hie 
eJMreii in fttfr/ecfion nMh all gravitj ; /or if a man know not 
how to rule hi$ own houte^ how ihqll he take care qf the church 
of 6od9 But sure I am, that Mr^ M^CuUa was no party.to 
the agreement cited above : he was too well acquainted with 
the duties of his office : nor had he the slightest suspicion of 
uny such having taken place : for they kept their minds and 
hearts shut up fh>m him, till the ' word of God* penetrated 
them, and set them all on fire ; and then they began to feel

Gibbs> was for a time the most forward of all to speak well 
of him^ aad to receive the woid with joy, &c. (Biatt. xiii. 80.) 
Notliiii§p on earth could be more vexing than to find, after all 
his blazing profession, that his heart was as far off from, 
receiving the troth, as sin is fh>m holiness. 

in. ''This same M'CuHa made hb boast, that he would 
preach mj foneral sermon; and that he would never cease 
pursuing me, tQl I was lodged in the pit of hdl with the 
prince of rebels* Some of his disciples have denied this; 
but I have his letter in m j house to this day, in his owa 
hand-writing, in whidi I can shew it vcftatim.** (P. 106.) 

I wish he had published the letter verbatim : and I ask 
why he did not } He coidd have no reason for withholding 
it, bttt the foar of publishing to the woiM a dear ttianifesta^ 
tkm of the deception of his own heart, and of his folse 
piofossion. It is more than probable that the above is a very- 
garbled statement : however the darkened and carnal state of 
Gibbs's mind is herein very much exposed. For we are well 
convinced, that nothing could be forther from the thoughts of 
Mr. M'Cuna, than 'preaching his funeral sermon* in the 
literal sense of the words. But as tiie preaching of Christ 
proved to be ' a savour of death' unto Gibbs ; hb name, of 
course, was soon 'blotted out of the book of lifo;* (Rev. 
iii. 6. and ladL 19.) tliat is, he was cut off from the com-* 
munion of saints, or rejected, as a heretic, according to* 
Ftenl*8 commandment : and his funeral sermon was truly and- 
spiritually pijeached, by the servant of Ihe Loed of Lifo,. 
many a time over. And as it is not very unlikely, but that- 
I may depart this lifo, before Mr. Gibbs, I take this oppor^ 
tunity of preaching it for him once more, by telling him^ ' <As 
wages of tinii death; for when a man has received the mark, 
of the beast in his forehead, (Rev. xiii. 16.) it is open for the 
reading of all the spiritual : and the word of the Loed is ; 
for U ii a people cf no vndebstandiko : kherefore he, thak

made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed 
them wUi shew them no favour. (Isa, zxvii. 11.) Elijah 
preached the funeral sermon of Baal's prophets^ by moeking 
them, and taming their religion into ridieale 3 and afterwards 
took and slew them« In all ages it has been the lot of the 
stewards of the divine mysteries, to behold much both of ' the 
goodness and of the severity of Qod/ (Rom. xi. 32.) And 
though they are constrained while contending earnestly for 
the fiuth against the wicked, to declare what is made known 
vnto them ^ yet the very view of it often makes them inter- 
ibally tremble, while they do declare it. The gospel of Christ 
is indeed life firom the dead to them that receive it ; but at 
the same time it most assuredly is the death warrant of all 
them that do not receive it. (Mark xvi. 16.) But thoie 
mtne enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, 
hring hither, and slay them before me. (Luke six. 27«) 
Christ preached the funeral sermon of the Jews, who 
^rejected his message of peace j yet wept with a most bitter 
lamentation, while he did preach it. (Luke xix. 41.) And 
suffered death himself within a few days after. 

As to ' pursuing him,' it is but too evident that he has the 
word of condemnation in his own conscience, ' being con- 
demned of himself,' as Paul says (Tit. iii. 9), which he finds 
U wlioUy out of his power to get rid of : and if he cannot 
escape its pursuit in this life, bow much less will he be able 
to escape it in eternity. '* Behold, ye despisers, and wonder 
and perish ; for I work a work in your days, a work wtuch ye 
shall in no wise heUeoe, though a man declare U unto you,** 
(Acts xiii. 41.) 

This infotuated enemy of truth chaiges Mr. M'CuIIa with 
' wishing him to be in hell.* Now it is very certain that tiie 
most hardened of Adam's corrupted posterity, whatever he 
might utter with his lips, never did from his heart wish tlie 
very, worst of his fellow-creatures to be in hell. It is quite 
contrary to human nature. Knowing that a man will be in

tils image indeed white on earth was grief: to Isaiah 
'described it: acquainted with grief.- (liii, S.) And »o Paul 
found it : if in lbi» life only we have hope, we are of all me« 
moat miserable. (1 Cor. xv. 19.) But a* sorrowful, yet alviatf 
rejoicing. (3 Cor. vi. I0.> In the midst of so much sorrow, 
whence then ariseth this rejoicing, yea, this joy which no 
man; no, nor yet sword; nor fire can take from us? It 
ariseth froni the 'hope of ^lory' formed within, by the 
spiaiT of the Redeemer, (Col. i. 27.) who haih placed us. as 
polished stones in that temple, in which he dwelletb; wherein 
he holdelh his court, far from the world's view. This hope 
of glory made known unto us, by the powerful voice of God 
spoken within the soul ; confirmed unto us by hia oath ; and 
sealed by his blood; this it is, that out-balaoceth alt our 
sorrow, and maketh ev^ry trial light, whether brought upon 
us by the false and wicked preachers of Satan, or the vain 
world, or our own corrupt hearts : this hope of glory it is, 
that causeth us, when in the enjoyment of faith, to long for, 
and to 'love his appearing:' <2 Tim. iv. 8.) to love the 
appearing, that is, the second coming of him, whose love the 
eloquence of Paul could find no language to express ; s&ying, 
that it 'paaseth knowledge.' (Eph. iii. 19.) Mark, it 
passeth knowledge ; and yet he is exceedingly anxions that we 
should kitoK if ; that is, know it in measure ; as much of it 
as our finite understandings are capable of conceiving : that 
Chriit may dwelt in your hearts by faith ; that ye being rooted 
and grounded in love, nay be able to comprehend viUh all 
tainli, uhat ii the breadth, and length, and depth, and height ; 
and TO KNOW the love of Christ, Ac. Such indeed, I well 
know, is hia love to me, in common with all his saints, that 
hia very reini rejoice, when my lips speak right things. (Prov, 
xxiii. 16.) And when do they speak right things > When 
that hallowed fire proceedeth out of them, which devouretli 
the ungodly. (Rev. xi. 5.) Yea, such, I well know, is his 
love to me, that in every trial, that my soul passeth through,
