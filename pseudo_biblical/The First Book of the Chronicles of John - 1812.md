1. And it came to pass in those days, that there was no King in all the land, even in all Columbia, but every one walked after the imagination of his own heart. 

2. And the people said one to another, "We will choose from among our own numbers Elders to rule over us, even discreet men, out of all the land of Columbia from the borders of the Great Lakes, Northward, till thou comest to the plains of the South, which abounds with Oranges, Pomegranates and Figs. 

3. "And let all the Elders meet together in the great city, even the city of Philadelphia, and make laws for us, for why should our goodly heritage be given up to strangers?" 

4. For, at this time, the Lord had visited them with a great affliction; for he had stirred up the King of Albion against them, who sent ships to destroy their commerce, and stirred up the barbarians to butcher their helpless old men and women and sucking babes.

5. Moreover, there was at that time a fierce and warlike Nation, even the people of Gallia, who said to the ambassadors of Columbia, "Pay us tribute, or we will send out fleets and armies to destroy your coasts."

6. And when the people heard these things, they were much troubled, and said one to another, "What shall we do."

7. Now behold at that time, there was a certain young man whose name was John, and the same was learned in the law!

8. And John stood forth in the midst of the five congregations, and stretched forth his hand and said, "Men and brethren, hearken unto me, I pray you."

9. Lo ! the people all kept silent, and John opened his mouth and said, "If you will choose me from amongst your own members to be one of the Elders, then will I be your friend, and I will plead your cause before the Elders of the land." Thus spoke he to the people of the five coutnies, and some were much pleased with the words which he spake, and some where not.

10. Lo ! the people cast lots, and the lot fell upon John, and the people said unto him, "Be not high minded nor puffed up, peradventure we may choose thee again to rule over us."

CHAP. II.

1. Now after all this was known, from the sea even unto the hill country, the Elders assembled together, even in the city of Philadelphia, and John was in the midst of them.

2. And John forgot not what he had said unto the people, but stood up and spake with power and authority, toughing the evils which spread over the land; and on this wise spake he:--

3. "Behold, O Elders of my people, the evils which surround us are very many and hard to be endured. Whilst the King of Albion robs us on the high seas and stirs up the savages against us, and the people of Gallia threaten us with tribute and war, domestic enemies and traitors prey on the vitals of the Republic.

4. "Amongst ourselves, O my countrymen, may be found the cause of all our troubles:

5. "Are not our Rulers overbearing, and too much attached to our old and inveterate enemy, the King of the Albions !

6. "Does not the Treaty we have just made surrender our most invaluable rights, at the shrine of insatiable despotic power?

7. "When the people murmered, because of these things, did not you make Alien and Sedition Laws, to awe them into silence ?

8. "Have you not by your own wrongs destroyed the liberty of the press, and rendered the ruler of our land more despotic than the king whose people we were.

9. "By pursuing this system, or rather this no system, we are pitied by our friends and laughed at by our enemies.

10. "Have you not voted Navies and Armies to aid the Albians against the people of Gallia ?

11. "Have you not multiplied officers and salaries for the purpose of oppression ?

12. "Could you expect our old friends and allies the Gallians to remain quiet, whilst she witnessed your preparations for war by sea and land ?

13. "O, my fellow citizens, let me tell you, these things are the cause of all our troubles.

14. "I will tell you what to do, dismiss your unworthy servants, disband the army, dismantle the navy, repeal your obnoxious laws, cultivate harmony at home and peace abroad.

15. The people of Gallia are not the most dangerous enemies; behold in them the founders of a mighty Republic in the Old World.

16. "Single-handed she has overthrown armies, dethroned kings, and has proclaimed to an astonished world the imprescriptible rights of man.

17. "Not so with the haughty and impious Albion ; fire, sword and destruction, have marked her progress from the Delaware to the Ganges."

18. And when the Elders heard the words that John had spoken, they said one to another, "What manner of man is this ? For behold he speaketh the words of truth."

19. Now truth was very powerful in those days.
