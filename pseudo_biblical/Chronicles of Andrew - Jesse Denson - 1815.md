The Chronicles of Andrew

And it came to pass in those days, in the fifth year of the reign of James, whose sirname is Madison, the supreme Governor of all Columbia's provinces, even in the thirtieth day of the eighth month, in the eighteen hundred and thirteenth year of the Christian era, that the barbarians that dwelt in the south waged war with the people of Columbia; and some Ethiopians did join them, and they came forth from the wilderness, and fell violently on the inhabitants of Columbia, and slew them with their helpless women and children, and consumed the strong hold with fire, and many living people therein, and few escaped the bloody slaughter.
Then the wise men of  the west came forward and assembled themselves together in council, and called for their young men and valiant men of war, saying, go forth, avenge the innocent blood of our slain brethren on the guilty heads of those numerous and uncircumcized philistines; “carry and exterminating war into the heart of the Creek Nation” and spare them not.
Then it was that Andrew, whose sirname is Jackson, a mighty man of war and valiant in fight, who lived in the west and ruled all the fighting men in the Western part of one of Columbia's provinces stretched out his arm, girded on his sword upon his thigh, and came forth in much wrath and indignation against those cruel and inhuman savages, and collected his warriors and marched them in haste to give relief to the frontier inhabitants in the South, who lay exposed to the heavy hand of a barbarous foe, and were daily lifting up their voices and sending messengers to Andrew and Willie, saying, come over and help us, or we shall fall by the hands of those uncircumcised Philistines who have defied the armies of the living God: our wives and our children will be slain, and desolation will suddenly spread over our land, unless thou come immediately; for behold the hostile thousands are assembling themselves together for war against us, and our men of war are few and a cloud of destruction gathereth blackness over our heads, and great danger surroundeth us,  Now the sole power was not in the wise men of the West to give laws to scourge nations, but the authority was in the hands of the great Sanhedrim to give laws to chastize heathen tribes for their transgressions.  Then the great Sanhedrim, being clothed with power, wisdom and equity, in her national grand council, solemnly ratified the righteous decrees of the wise men of the west, and proclaimed upon the house top, saying, go forth as ye have said in pomp and power, persevere in your laudable undertakings; scourge those transgressing heathens who feareth not God nor regardeth the rights of nations; drive furiously through their country-- trample down their false prophets and send their soothsaying and heathen enthusiasm to the bottomless pit, from whence it came; and cause their magic conjuration to fall like lightening from heaven.  Ye are able to go against them; hasten to the field of battle-- clothe yourselves with martial courage in the thundering field of Mars, and give speedy relief to our distressed brethren in the south; go forth and the Lord of Hosts will deliver them into your hands.  Ye shall spare not their men of war, but slay them hip and thigh, captivate their women and children-- drive them out, fight our battles in the south and we will maintain and reward your labours.  Go, and the Lord will be with you.  Then Andrew's heart was cheered, and he marched his thundering bright army into the borders of the enemy's country, in the way as thou goest from Huntsville, Mississippi Territory, to the river Alabama.

Chapter I
 Oct 30, 1813.  Joseph the High Priest, whose sir name is Dorris encourageth the men of war.  
Tune-- Alknomac.
Commanders and soldiers we'll join heart and hand; 
And sweep all before us in this Indian land.
We’ll press for their nation, Jackson leads the way;
He points out our rules-- his commands we'll obey.

Behold his bright army it moves like a cloud,
All cloathed with thunder and storm on the road.
We're bound for their towns and determin'd to slay,
We fear they'll not meet us, but all run away.

We'll roam thro' their nation secure as we go,
We'll build us strong stations, and man them also;
We'll chase the vile redsticks quite down to the sea,
And there we'll surround them in Pensacola.

But hark, brother soldier, a sound strikes my ear,
The cries of the women and children I hear.
The Indians all round and Fort Mimms set on fire,
Which raises ambition still higher and higher.

Ye Tennessee heroes the prize keep in view
And ne'er turn your backs, but the savage subdue.
We'll make them submit to the laws we maintain;
Return home in peace to our darlings again.

We'll sing and forget the fatigues of the way--
In peace and in pleasure we'll crown the glad day.
Give glory and honour to God the Supreme;
Brave patriots of freedom will all say AMEN.

Chapter II
John, whose sirname is Coffee, taketh one thousand horsemen of Andrew's army, and goeth up against the enemy at Tallesetchee; tarrieth at night by the way; next morning he encloseth them around and putteth the warriors to the sword-- consumeth their village with fire, and spareth the women and children-- he returneth to the army, which had moved on and pitched their tents at the Ten Isles, on the West side of Coosa river-- is received by Andrew with great joy and triumph.  
                November 2, 1813
Then Coffee and Hammon embark'd for their town
A number of Indian warriors they found--
The Indians beheld them and raised their yells.
And rush'd out with fury like fiends from their cells.

The Hammon retreated; at length made a stand;
Was joined by the rear; then we all took a hand.
We killed two hundred, and sav'd thirty-nine--
Took forty, or more, but we left them behind.

Their huts we surrounded-- the scene was quick o'er;
We fired their town while they welter'd in gore.
A squaw with an arrow a white man did slay.
We conquer's them all-- one or two got away.

The sight of it was awful for man to behold;
Some wounded, some infants, and some very old.
Our gen'ral's compassion did move in his breast;
He left some old squaws to take care of the rest.

Then Coffee returned and made no delay--
He lost five brave warriors-- arriv'd the same day:
His men were such heroes-- their valour was great;
The battle was hot and the conquest complete.

“A Kingdom divided against itself, cannot stand.”
        Author of Redemption.
Now it was so, that a great division had arose amongst the Muscogie people.  Some did say, let us not fight against the people of Columbia; they are our neighbours and friends; they give us protection and we are their annuitants; our nation is weak, and their nation is strong; their young men are very numerous, and violent on the red people, when provoked by them; and why will we pull down death and desolation on ourselves, our wives, and our children, and thus be driven from our peaceable habitations, and a land of plenty.
But, behold it was so, that a great Prophet of the Shawonee tribes of barbarians from the North, had visited the Muscogie tribes in the South, and said unto them, thus sayeth the Big Man above, (the master of the breath) ye shall fight against the people of Columbia; the earth shall open its mouth and swallow them up in your presence; ye shall have power given you from above to shake the earth and turn their power to sand;  and the white people shall be terrified, and fear shall seize hold on them, and they shall flee before you like grass-hoppers; ye shall chase them from their dwellings and drive them into the sea; ye shall prevail over them and slay them, male and female, from the lest unto the greatest, and leave them neither root nor branch.  And thus we, the red people, will possess our own native land in peace again, and none to make us afraid: and all the houses, cattle and treasures of the white people shall be ours.  And if so be, that Columbia's armies should prove too strong for you at first, then ye shall flee to the sea-coast towards the south, that there your good father and friend at Pensacola will help you; also, the big man of the great water (king George) will aid and assist you with warriors, and supply you with all things that ye shall need: for behold of a truth, his Britannic majesty delighteth to war with the people of Columbia.  
These and many other strange doctrines and new sayings were received by the barbarians in the South; and many false prophets arose amongst them, and a great strife, war and bloodshed prevailed in their councils; for behold the peaceable barbarians had slain the murderers who had committed the cruel massacres on the fair daughters of Columbia near the mouth of Duck river: and the friendly party was too weak for the bloodthirsty warriors, and they fled for their lives in many directions with their women and children-- some of  them sought refuge among the people of Columbia and some in the borders of their own country and built bulworks of defence.  Now Fort Lashley was a strong hold, on a beautiful mount, handsome for situation, on the heights of Talledega, where the land was not barren, nor the water naught, wherein dwelt a number of harmless Indians.  And it came to pass that numerous hosts of the horrid crew came up against them and encamped in the plains of Talledega, over against Fort Lashley, and did slay and eat the swine and fatted oxen of those within the strong hold, and did invade them, saying “come out and join us and fight against the Americans, or we will suddenly destroy you, your wives and your children, and that without remedy; and consume your strong hold with fire.”  Then those within were dismayed and great fear fell upon them; and they said to them without, “we pray you indulge us for a time, and after we have consulted among ourselves we will do even as ye have said: “ for those within were not able to fight against those without; for the number of their warriors were few, and their women and children many; and they said among themselves “we shall surely be cut off with out little ones, by this cruel generations of vipers, except we can acquaint Andrew of the matter, and he will hasten to our relief; for, behold he is our friend, and is able to deliver us out of the hand of the enemy.”  Now Andrew was encamped at Ottapolee, (which by interpretation is Ten Islands) about ten score furlongs, from Fort Lashley;  and those within sent a runner secretly to Andrew, saying “come down with your tremendous army, and delay not, or we shall fall into the hands of those rebellious heathens, who have destroyed our herds of swine and cattle, and now waiteth to destroy our lives.  Peradventure, by telling them many smooth tales, we may cause them to delay the fatal blow until thou shalt come; for surely we desire to betray them into your hands.
Chapter III
Andrew, the chief captain, holdeth a council with his principal men, and marcheth his courageous army against the savage foe at Talledega-- he formeth his men of war all around them and bringeth on the battle; and putteth the savage tribes to flight-- slayeth them hip and thigh, and covereth the bloody plains of Tallega with slaughtered carcasses.
November 17, 1813
Then Jackson and Coffee and Roberts and Hall
Determined to try all the prophets of Baal.
Their colonels and majors and captains agree--
Gave hearty consent to their solemn decree.

A council was called at Ottapolee
And orders were issu'd for Talledega.
The men were so willing-- refused to stay--
We cross'd Coosa river some hours before day.

We marched all day and encamped at night,
Next morning arriv'd and prepar'd for the fight,
Then Carroll and Gordon advanced to spy.
In order to see where the Indians did lie;

On th' ninth of November the battle began, 
By Deadrick's and Bledsoe's and Caperton's men,
Surrounded by Jackson's bright thundering band,
Before his brave heroes they never can stand.

The force of the Indians, engaged with the spies, 
Was sorely repulsed to their sad surprize:
The army enclos'd them wherever they stood,
They broke and the squander'e all over the wood

When th' battle was o'er we return'd and we found,
The number three hundred lay dead on the ground.
We bound up our wounded-- our dead was fifteen:
Next day we return'd with our laurels again.
Chapter IV
The people murmur against Andrew for want of bread—forsaketh him in the wilderness, and fleeth to their habitations.  Andrew beateth up for volunteers; One hundred men stays with the baggage, in the midst of danger, without any stronghold of defense.
November 11, 1813.

The army arriv'd at the camp much in want, 
And murmur'd throughout, for the bread it was scant;
All weary and hungry, and worn out complete,
And when we got there scarce a ration to eat.

The contractors failed:  supplies they had none,
Then Jackson was blamed; where others were wrong,
A murmuring spirit, among them did rise,
Commanders and soldiers like to mutinize.

The signal was given to raise volunteers,
One hundred brave soldiers with courage appears,
To stay in the antion the ground to maintain,
Till forces were brought to head-quarters again.

Then Jackson discovr'd the danger was great;
It strengthn'd the foe-- it weaken'd the state.
He sent them to Nashville to ease their complaint;
If Willie releas'd they were free from restraint.

Chapter V
William, a Rabbi, whose surname is Carroll, recruiteth an army of two months' horsemen, and leadeth them on to Andrew in the wilderness—Andrew goeth against the heathen tribes at Tallapoosa with a small army-- the heathens gathereth themselves together from many cities and cometh up to meet Andrew, and giveth him battle-- Andrew defeateth them in four actions and returneth to his strong hold.
January 16, 1814.
Then Carroll advanced and march'd the recruits
And joined the army and strengthened the troops.
January the sixteenth we march'd away
To meet the red foe on the Tallapoosa.

With one thousand men we Arriv'd near their fort,
In six days was pitch'd at the camp call'd Lookout. 
January 22, 1814.
Three battles brought on by the foe the next day;
They fought us a while, but we drove them away.

On th' heights of Emuckfaw they raised the yell;
Then Coffee and Russell they did them repel.
Our brave Gen'ral Coffee received a wound--
Donaldson and Packston fell dead on the ground.

Amidst of their nation our forces were few,
A council was call'd what was then best to do.
T'return in good order and march back again--
So near the Oakfusky we must not remain.

We did not intend for to make much delay--
Their forces collecting we hurry'd away.
They came and attacked the army again--
they paid for it dearly-- a number were slain.

January 24, 1814.
At Entochopco they rais'd their war whoops--
Confusion was spread through the rear of the troops--
We rally's our forces-- dispers'd them again.
Qualls, Evans, and Hamilton, fell with the slain.

Altho' they were naked, the weather was cold;
they took the advantage and fought very bold.
The cannon did utter its thundering voice--
They ceased their yells and their heels were their choice.

Our bold gen'ral's conduct has made them afraid
Surrounded with danger his bravery display'd.
Breast works we did build-- a forc'd march did maintain--
He brought us quite safe to Fort Strother again.

Tho' cold did impede, in twelve days of a route
We killed two hundred, or near thereabout.
With grief and with sorrow I have now to tell
That twenty of Jackson's brave warriors have fell.

Chapter VI
Willie, whose sirname is Blount, (a chief warrior of one of Columbia's provinces) sendeth Andrew a formidable army-- Andrew marcheth his conquering thousands against the Philistine hosts at the river Tallapoosa-- he encloseth the Philistine army around and putteth the battle in array, army against army-- the savage hosts yelleth and shouteth for the battle-- Andrew causeth his destroying engines to utter forth their loud thundering voices, and spew out fire and destruction on the red army.  The Earth quaketh and the Heavens echoeth with a mighty sound.  One of their false prophets cometh up and mocketh Andrew's army-- Andrew scaleth their walls and felleth to the ground three of their soothsaying prophets, who had caused the people to go astray.  The fire and smoke covereth the valley between.  Columbia's bright army receiveth a sheet of fire from the breastworks in charging on the enemy and contendeth warmly with them, muzzle to muzzle, for the port holes-- Andrew maketh captive their women and children and entirely defeateth the philistine army, and maketh a bloody havoc among them, and returneth in pomp and splendor to the stronghold.

March 14, 1814.

Then forces were marched-- four thousand brave men,
the fourteenth of March to Fort Strother again.
Then Jackson review'd us and marched us on, 
We'd plenty of cannon, but tories not one.

In six days we came to Fort Williams below--
Establish'd the station and mann'd it also.
On the twenty-fourth day we marched away
to storm the stronghold on the Tallapoosa.

T' their fortification we instantly came,
And put their imposterous prophet to shame.
The Armies appeared in battle array
And Jackson's loud cannon upon them did play.

At first we attempted by the cannon ball
To shatter their breastworks and beat down the wall,
Till vengeance and courage did grow very warm;
We charg'd on their stronghold and took it by storm.

On Sunday the seven and twentieth day
Of March, in the morning, we thunder'd away;
The roaring of cartridge and sound of the drum--
Like heaven and earth quite together had come.

Our heroes undaunted at powder and ball;
Commanders and soldiers, a number did fall.
Here Andrew's brave heroes did bleed with their wounds,
Midst roaring and yelling and musical sounds.

Now Coffee so brave, with his valiant brigade,
Had cross'd on the right, thro' the river did wade;
They form'd in order, surrounded the bend,
And down the bold river red tokens did send.

They fought us with fury from first to the last, 
Altho' they were slaughtered by hundreds so fast.
Our forces were formed with skill all around,
And scarcely one red stick escap'd from the ground:

Some hundreds we bury'd in the liquid grave,
And nearly four hundred red captives did save.
The river run bloody at this awful scene--
All sexes and sizes lay dead on the green.

Till next day we slew them, not one seem'd afraid;
Thro' blood, death and carnage, we caus'd them to wade;
three Muscogie prognosticators did fall;
Destruction to all the false prophets of Baal.

The New-Youka borders died echo and sound;
Their painted red bodies lay thick on the ground;
The scene was tremendous-- the engines did roar--
We slaughter'd eight hundred red warriors or more.

The troops were all valiant and keen to rush on,
Commanded in person by Gen'ral jackson.
A glorious vict'ry Columbia did gain;
Lost forty-nine only-- fell dead on the plain.

Such bravery and courage I never did see;
They paid for Fort Mimms at the Tallapoosa.
We dress'd all our wounded and bury'd our slain;
Immediately march'd for Fort Williams again.
Chapter VII
Andrew returneth from the slaughter of the Philistines-- putteth his army in order and goeth down against the frightened foe, who had assembled themselves together lower down the river Talapoosa.  The barbarians feareth to meet Andrew-- forsaketh their houses and cities and fleeth into the wilderness towards the South; some of them beseecheth Andrew for peace, for behold a famine cometh into their land.  Andrew marcheth through the enemy's country, unfurleth Columbia's bright wavering banner in magnanimous style, in the desert.  Andrew giveth deliverance, peace, and protection, and bringeth glad tidings of great joy to all people in the south-- for behold he is their temporal savior-- he ceaseth to chase the Muscogies and marcheth his conquering thousands out of the South country and returneth in aggrandized splendor to his own land in the west-- is received with great acclamations of joy and gladness.

The army arrived quite safe in four days, 
With laurels of vict'ry ascending in praise.
The seventh of April in martial array
We marched again for the Tallapoosa.

We march'd seven days and we came to their town,
And found it forsaken-- we burned it down.
We ranged around and some captives obtain'd--
They'd all run away; scarce a warrior remain'd.

We marched in splendor by the Hick'ry Ground,
No hostile appearance of foes there we found;
Some white, and some black, and some red, did come in,
Quite starved for bread, and for peace did begin.

The Muscogie nation had suffer'd full sore;
They got panic struck and would fight us no more, 
The times were so hot they refused to stay,
But fled to the deserts of Alabama.

And ancient French fort near the junction we found
Large pieces of cannon lay waste on the ground,
We came near the head of the Alabama,
A country so pleasant, rich, handsome, and gay.

With forces from Georgia and Carolina
A junction was form'd at the Tallapoosa.
    April 21, 1814
Then Jackson he marched his bright royal band
For th' green shady bowers of sweet Cumberland.

On Sunday the twenty-fourth, Jesse the scribe
And Milton set sail with the wind and the tide;
We came to the heights of the Alabama,
Though foes in abundance were camp's by the way.

Chapter VIII
Andrew for the love he hath for Columbia's cause and his beloved country, leaveth his habitation and marcheth again with a small army into the South and holdeth out a flag of truce, and offereth pardon, peace and protection to all barbarians, whosoever will come and seek shelter under Columbia's glittering banner, and sweareth by the eternal God to execute vengeance and destruction on all those who refuse to lay down their arms of rebellion; for behold Andrew, though he had waxed great and strong in wealth, power and dignity, yet he blusheth not to take the name of the Lord his God in vain.  Many of the chief rulers and principal men of the Muscogie tribes cometh forward and communeth with Andrew in council-- and many of the barbarians refused to come to Andrew for peace; but voweth with tongues of bitterness, in much anger that as their kindred and brethren have fell in the field of battle, so they will also fall by Andrew's heavy hands, before they will submit.  But they sware not at all; for behold the barbarians cannot frame to pronounce profaneness or blasphemy against God in their own tongue;  but when they borrow words from the people of Columbia, and are taught the English language, then they furiously utter oaths and imprecations.  Then the Muscogie chiefs who had been in council with Andrew, after some days, did agree amongst themselves, that rather than do worse, they would comply with Andrew's proposals, and give up the Western and Southern part of their country; and on the ninth day of the eighth month, in the eighteen hundred and fourteenth year of the Christian epoch, and the stong hold (Fort Jackson) did shake hands and sign a treaty with Andrew, giving and ceding to the people of Columbia, one score millions of acres of land lying West and South of the boundary line as follows:
Beginning on the Coosa at a pont on the eastern bank of the river, where the south boundary of the Cherokee nation crosses the same; running from thence down the east bank of the Coosa to one mile above the mouth of Cedar creek at Fort Williams, thence east two miles, thence south two miles, thence west two miles to the eastern bank of  said Coosa; thence down the eastern bank thereof according to the various meanders to a point opposite the upper end of the great falls called by the natives Woetumka--
Thence east on a true meridian line to a point due north of the Oakfusky, thence south my a line running to the mouth of Oakfusky on the south side of the Tallapoosa river, thence up the said Oakfusky according to its various meanders to a point where a direct course will cross the same, at the distance of ten miles from the mouth thereof, thence a direct line to the mouth of Semmichico creek, with empties into the Chatahoochie river on the east side thereof, below the Eufaluee town, thence east by a true meridian line to a point which shall intersect the line now dividing the lands claimed by the said Creek nation from those claimed and owned by Georgia.

The Andrew he marched with one thousand men
And quickly arriv'd at Fort Jackson again--
Proposed a treaty and many comply'd, 
While some stood aloof on the Britannic side.

Chapter IX
And it came to pass that the residue of the hostile barbarians who had not fallen by Andrew's sword or by famine, assembled themselves together at Pensacola, a village on the sea side, in the south, in the dominions of King Charles of Madrid in Spain, on the other side of the sea; and some of the men of Britain came in ships to meet their savage brethren at Pensacola; for behold the people of Columbia were at war with George their king.  And the red barbarians of the south said to the white barbarians of England, what have ye been doing so long a time? Why did not our great and mighty father the King help us to fight the people of Columbia as he promised?  Behold our prophets have lied unto us, George the King hat deceived us, and Captain Jackson hath slain our brethren, and the sword and famine have desolated our land; and we have escaped with our lives!!  Then the British barbarians and their ruler, Colonel Nicholls said unto the redsticks we assure you our beloved brethren and friends that our Lord the King hath not forgotten you; but the King's men have been fighting the people of Columbia to the north at Canada and our mighty armies have been engaged with the combined forces of Europe against the people of Gaul; and we have conquered them, and have pulled down the great and terrible emperor of Gaul (Bonaparte) from his throne, and confined him to the island of Elba; from whence he never shall come forth again to terrify the nations of the earth; and this it not all the good news that we have to tell you; the King's principal men at the North did give strong intoxicating drink to our red brethren on purpose, and they did burn the prisoners and wounded of Jemmy Madison on the river Raisin at French Town.  And we did take another town (Hampton, Va.) and the King's soldiers had a fine time; they did compel the women of Columbia to lie with them by force, And we have driven another of their large armies before us and did go into their fine City (Washington) to the East and did drive Mr. Madison the Great Governor of America from his throne, and did burn his palace and the beautiful statehouse also with fire, where all the wise men of Columbia assemble in Congress; and now we are come to avenge you on your enemies, and show you how to plunder their cities and enjoy their women by force.  Then the Muccogie barbarians said to the barbarians of Britain, we are glad to hear that our white enemies (Mr. Madison's men) and destroyed his cities with fire: but we red people whom you Christians call savages, that know nothing about the Christian God do not force the women of any nation of people, but when we take prisoners in battle, the laws of female virtue and chastity are sacred to us; and even the beasts of the field and cattle on a thousand hills teach us better human modesty that this, therefore let not the red people be called barbarians and cruel any more, when thus it cometh to pass the a Christian people from a civilized nation (England) teacheth us unprecedented cruelty unknown to us in times of war or peace although we torture them to death many days.  Now Charles and James were not at war against each other, but the Governor at Pensacola did receive the redsticks and the men of Britain and did show himself friendly to them whom Andrew did mortally hate, then Andrew called for volunteers.  Then John, whose heart was knit with Andrew, assembled his warriors and put them on horseback, and hastened by way of St. Stephens, to Andrew, and Andrew collecteth and army and marcheth to Pensacola and said to the Governor of the City.
How is it that you nourish and harbour the British and Indians my enemies?  Have ye a mind to war against Columbia?  And the Governor mocked Andrew and showed him contempt.  Then Andrew immediately arose like a lion, and (Jehu like) did rush furiously on the Spaniards, and did slay them on the right and on the left.  Then the Governor did beg for mercy at Andrew's hands, saying, “we did not command our men to oppose you or shoot at your soldiers, but it was our unruly men that did do this evil.” Meanwhile the Britons and redsticks made haste to their ships and boats and fled form the face of Andrew's army and went into the sea.  Then Andrew's army ceased against the Spaniards and he marched his valiant army into our dominions again.

Chpater X
Then the servants of George said, “O King live forever, Andrew hath driven us from Pensacola with our savage allies.  And after that we went up in our ships with our destroying engines to Fort Bowyer at Mobile point near the sea shore, and our red brethren with us, on land our men of war were many and the Americans in the strong hold were very few.  And we did attack it and behold we were whipped, and your faithful servant (Col. Nicholls) who invited the Kentuckians to join the king, has lost an eye my a grape shot.  He is sorely maimed and half dead; many of our men killed and our ships destroyed, so that we were obliged shamefully to retreat before Major Lawrence and his little handful.  O King!  Except we have men like the stars of heaven for multitude we cannot fight against Andrew, therefore we thy principal men, chief captains and servants, beseech thy majesty's highness and all thy rulers to send us warriors in abundance, and we will slay Andrew and his undisciplined armies in the South of Columbia's Continent, and take the City of Orleans and the country round about, and thus we will extend our trade and dominions in America, for surely this is a desirable country round about, for surely this is a desirable country of great increase of the merchant men, and will bring much wealth to the King.  Then Edward whose sirname was Packenham, one of the chief captains of the king's boats did fill his ships with soldiers and instruments of war, and did spread their sails to the wind, and did ride on the raging seas, and came like a hail storm with thunder and lightening and much rain:  and landed his furious host  at the sea side, not far distant from New-Orleans, and did come up thousands upon thousands! With many engines and weapons of death, with glittering steel and sword in hand! And did appear terrible as an army with banners, saying “we are the king makers, ye cannot stand before us, we are expert in war, and ye are raw militia, therefore surrender to us and we will take your country and spare you; for behold we are the King's veterans, who have subdued the numerous armies of Gaul, and pulled down their mighty monarch Bonaparte, and hace restored Louis the 16th of the Bourbon family to the throne, and crowned him King of France, whom Napoleon, that great conqueror had dispossessed of the Kingdom! And we will plunder your cities and embrace your wives and your sisters, we will bring down your haughty pride before we leave you.” Thus spake the British barbarians to the Madisonites.  Now Andrew was aware of the approach of the King's armies in the South, and he had called on Willie again for a large army, and William a young well skilled man in war, collected the soldiers in Tennessee, and conveyed them in haste down the river Mississippi in boats to Andrew.  And Isaac whose sirname is Shelby, who governed the colony of Kentucky, did also sent Andrew a goodly number of resolute warriors down the Mississippi.  Then Andrew's heart burned within him with love for Columbia's cause and he gathereth his courageous armies together from four provinces, a large army anxious for the fight, and pitched his tents about two leagues below the City of Orleans and built bulwarks, and prepared for the battle, and said to the King's servants, in the strength of the mighty God of hosts I have come down to oppose you in your avaricious and wicked designs, and defend our country from ravage, and the fair daughters of Columbia from your debouched cruelties.  Now the armies had been almost one score of days fighting and sending forth balls of fire and combustibles of destruction from their thundering engines, and behold Andrew 's  heroes proved victorious over the Britons and slew many of them in several battles, so that the minions of George were wroth against the Americans and on the eighth day of the first month in the eighteen hundred and fifteenth year of the Christian epoch, and thirty-ninth year of the Independence of all Columbia's provinces, on the first day of the week, early in the morning, Edward appeared in battle array, and marched his army to storm Andrew's strong hold and came up like a mighty rushing wind, while both armies were shouting for victory, and eager to bring on the battle, when Andrew gave command, and all at once his conquering heroes bursteth forth fire and destruction on the Britons, and slew George their chief captain.  The King's men filled with courage and fury rusheth violently into the jaws of death several times before they could own they were conquered.  A tremendous sound is heard like the roaring of many waters.  Andrew hoisteth the floodgates of power and poureth forth a torrent of desolation on the Britons, moweth them down in whole columns and slayeth them hip and thigh by many thousands, and spreadeth death and carnage over the crimson plains of Louisiana with slain Britons; for behold the God of war, power and victory, shieldeth Andrew's army in the hollow of his hand and giveth him a complete victory, such as was never known in battle before.  The king's army retreateth to their stronghold and holdeth a council saying what kind of folks are those Tennesseans and Kentuckians?  Surely they are not salt-water militia, such as we found at Washington City.  From what race of people did they spring?  Behold Andrew's army are all sharp-shooters and strangers to fear-- we cannot kill them-- they slay us one upon the top of another; even we the King's veterans, who were never conquered before.  Surely the God of Israel fighteth against us, or Gen. Washington hath risen from the dead.  But and if Andrew be of the seed of the Irish before whom we have begun to fall, the King's servants shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him.  Then the men of England said let us hasten and flee from the presence of Andrew with the few officers and soldiers we have left, for we have not had time to bury our dead, only as Andrew granted us liberty.  And they made haste to go down into their ships, and set sail into the sea and departed, saying alas! Alas! Bad news for our Master the king!!  The people of Orleans rejoiceth with Andrew for their deliverance-- the delicate fair damsels crowneth him with magnificent honour and exalteth him to the skies.  All the people in every city and village throughout Columbia's provinces lighteth their candles, maketh merry within their hearts, and rejoiceth at the news with exceeding great joy.  Except some few called tories, that were scattered over America, who were friends to the King, and against their own country, and have escaped the gallows, yea even still yet.

Andrew writeth a letter to James, whose surname is Monroe who kept all the books of the Chronicles of Columbia's wars.
7th military District, New-Orleans, June 15, 1815.
Sir,
“Early in the morning of the 8th, the enemy advanced in two strong columns on my right and left.  They were received, however with a firmness, which it seems, they little expected, and which defeated all their hopes.-- My men undisturbed by their approach, which indeed they had long anxiously wished for, opened upon them a fire so deliberate and certain as rendered their scaling ladders and fascines, as well as their more direct direct implements of war, perfectly useless.  For upwards of an hour it was continued with a briskness of which there have been few instances, perhaps, in any country.  In justice to the enemy, it must be said, they withstood it as long as could have been expected from the most determined bravery.  At length, however, when all prospect of success became hopeless, they fled in confusion from the field-- leaving it covered with their dead and wounded.  Their loss was immense, the total 2600.  My loss is inconsiderable; being only seven killed, and six wounded.
The force with which he landed must undoubtedly be diminished by at least 8000.  Besides the loss which he sustained on the night of the 23d ult.  which is estimated at 400, he cannot have suffered less between that period and the morning of the 1st inst. Than 300; having within that time been repulsed in two general attempts to drive us from our position, and there having been continual cannonading and skirmishing during the whole of it.

There is little doubt that the commanding general, sir Edward Packenham, was killed in the action of the 8th, and that Maj. Gen. Kean and Gibbs were badly wounded.
My loss in killed since the landing of the enemy, does not exceed 56.
I have the honour to be, &c.”
Andrew Jackson
Major General Commanding
Andrew formeth his victorious army and offereth them grateful applause for their brave conduct in battle and lifteth their meritorious honours to the clouds.
Citizens and Fellow Soldiers,      Jan 21
The enemy has retreated, and your general has now leisure to proclaim to the world what he has noticed with your admirations and pride-- your undaunted courage, your patriotism, and patience under hardships and fatigues, have reaped the fruits of an honourable union.  This day completes the fourth week since fifteen hundred of you attacked treble your number of men who boasted of their discipline, and their services under a celebrated leader in a long and eventful war.-- A few hours was sufficient to unite the gallant band, though at the moment they received the welcome order to march, they were separated many leagues in different directions from the city.  The gay rapidity of the march, the cheerful countenances of the officers and men, would have induced a belief that some festive entertainment, not the strife of battle, was the object to which they hastened with so much eagerness and hilarity.  In the conflict which ensued, the same spirit was supported.  Scarcely were your lines a protection against musket shot, when on the 28th a disposition was made to attack them with all the pomp and parade of military tactics.
Their batteries of heavy cannon kept up an incessant fire; their rockets illuminated the air, under their cover two strong columns threatened our flanks.  The foe insolently thought that this spectacle was too imposing to be resisted, and in the intoxication of his pride he already saw our lines abandoned without a contest—how were those menacing appearances met?
By shouts of defence, by a manly countenance not to be shaken by the roar of his cannon, by the glare of his firework rockets; by an artillery served,with superior skill and with deadly effect.  Never, my brave friends, can your general forget the testimonials of attachment to our glorious cause, of indignant hatred to our foe, of affectionate confidence in your chief, that resounded from every rank as he passed along your line.  This animating and unexpected scene damped the courage of the enemy; he dropped his scaling ladders and fascines, and the threatened attack dwindled into a demonstration which served only to shew the emptiness of his parade, and to inspire you with a just confidence in yourselves.
The new year was ushered in with the most tremendous fire his whole artillery could produce-- a few hours only, however, were necessary for the brave and skillful men who directed our own to dismount his cannon, destroy his batteries, and effectively silence his fire.
On the 8th of January the final effort was made.  At the dawn of day the batteries opened, and the column advanced.  Knowing that the volunteers from Tennessee and the militia from Kentucky were stationed on your left, it was there they directed their chief attack.  A fire incessantly kept up, directed with calmness and with unerring aim, strewed the field with brave officers and men of the column which slowly advanced, according to the most approved rules of European tactics, and was cut down by the untutored age of American militia.  Unable to sustain this galling and unceasing fire, some hundreds nearest nearest the entrenchments called for quarters, which was granted-- the rest retreating, were rallied at some distance, but only to make them a surer mark for the grape and cannister shot of our artillery, which, mowed down whole ranks at every discharge: and at length they precipitately retired from the field.
Our right hand had only a short contest to sustain with a few rash men who fatally for themselves, forced their entrance into the unfinished redoubt on the river.  They were quickly dispossessed, and this glorious day terminated with the loss to the enemy of their commander in chief one major general killed, another major general wounded, the most experienced and bravest of their officers, and more than three thousand men killed, wounded and missing: while our ranks, my friends, were thinned only by the loss of six of our brave companions killed and seven disabled by wounds-- wonderful imposition of heaven!  Unexampled event in the history of war!
Let us be grateful to the God of Battles who has directed the arrows of indignation against our invaders, while he covered with his protecting shield the brave defenders of their country.
After this unsuccessful and disastrous attempt, their spirits were broken, their force was destroyed, and their whole attention was employed in providing the means of escape.  This they effected: leaving their heavy artillery in our power, and many of their wounded to our clemency.  The consequences of this short, but decisive campaign, are incalculably important.-- The pride of our arrogant enemy humbled, his forces broken, his leaders killed.
On the other side, unanimity established, your country saved from conquest, your property form pillage, your wives and daughters from insult and violation, and the union preserved.  These, my brave friends, are the consequences of the efforts you have made, and the success with which they have been crowned by heaven.
Andrew is cloathed with laurels of honour and robes of dignity among the people of Columbia-- he standeth on the mountain top, like the lofty oak of Bashan or as the tall cedar of Lebanon; and his protecting branches spreadeth o'er the invaded continent; far distant nations shall hear of his power; his fame shall echo from generation to generation, in applauded strains of martial grandeur, and his name shall not be forgotten among the children of men; and among the warriors throughout Columbia's provinces, there was none found greater than Andrew.

Now Andrew has immortalized his name,
Rising generations shall read of his fame.
Let savage hosts tremble and Great Britain fear--
Of Jackson's achievements with awe they shall hear.

Ye brave sons of freedom the cause we'll maintain;
In strong bonds of union and friendship remain;
We'll give all the praise to Jehovah's great name,
Columbia's bright armies have conquer'd again.

Thus endeth the CHRONICLES OF ANDREW whose sirname is Jackson, the chief captian of Columbia's hosts, when he led his thousands through the south country in search of the barbarians that dwelt in the deserts of Alabama and to conquer the minions of the king of Albion, who pitched their tents on the plains of Louisisna; written by Jesse the Scribe, on the fifteenth day of the second month, in the eighteen hundred and fifteenth year of the Christian Hegira.  

DEAD MARCH
Come all surviving heroes, parents, children and friends,
Our losses are so great, more than wealth can make amends;
Our friends have fell in battle, where cannons loud did roar,
While many wounded heroes lay welt'ring in their gore.

So valiantly they fought and so gloriously they fell--
The pride of all the nation; their trophies we will tell.
The fate of war experienc'd, they've met their final doom;
Their spirits gone to glory, their bodies to the tomb.

We'll cease to mourn their absence and wipe away our tears;
The God of war supports us-- our favour'd banner spares,
We'll rally round the standard, maintain our liberty
And fight Columbia's battles in bonds of unity.

The British foe invades us ha plows the raging seas
And wishes to subdue us and rule us as they please.
Both savages and tories have join'd to bring us low, 
Such cruel horrid actions committed by the foe.

Our seamen they've impressed and starv'd them in the cold, 
Our wounded men have burnt and our fair by force did hold,
Inviting spies and traitors our union to destroy,
Such foes as British tyrants our land shall not enjoy.

Cheer up Columbia's heroes our fathers gain'd the day,
We'll follow their example and drive our foes away.
We'll rise like sons of thunder oppose their tyrant laws
And trust the God of nations on such a righteous cause.

And when the wars are ended and death comes to convey,
Our spirits home to praise our God in endless day;
Through Christ we'll meet in glory on Canaan's happy shore.
Where wars and loud commotions and fightings all are o'er.
