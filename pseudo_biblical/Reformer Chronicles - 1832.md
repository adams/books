CHRONICLES.
Chapter 2.

1. Now it came to pass during the 7th month, of the fourth year of the reign of Andrew, that a prophesy came from abroad, and spread afar over the country, yea, even from the North to the South, and from the East to the West, foretelling that the Land was to be visited by a dreadful Scourge, which was to sweep from the face of the Earth, a vast multitude of people.

2. The people gathered themselves together, and said one unto another, what have we done to bring down this calamity upon our heads, shurely [sic] we have not sinned against the laws of our Maker, that he should punish us so severely with his judgement. now the people humbled themselves in their demeanour, for they were afraid.

3. Now there was one Samuel, a man well stricken in years, and of lengthy proportions, who became afraid (for he was a sinful man, and feared the vengeance of the Lord would fall upon his head;. so he anointed with camphor, and provided himself with elixers, and preventatives, which he bestowed in abundance about his person, and with a powerful nostrum in his hand, which he applied to the handle of his face, with snuffing's like unto a mad Bull.

4. Now Samuel, who looked like a knight of the pestal and mortar, took his Chariot and drove to the publick places of the City, and exhorted the people to humble themselves before their Lord and Maker, and to arm themselves with cleanliness to baffle the inroads of the cholera.

5. For the man verily thought in his necessity, that ablutions before the Lord, and pious exclamations in the presence of the people, exhorting them to piety, temperance, and to honest, and fair dealings one with another, would wipe away the foul sins of his youth.

6. About this time, the rulers of the people humbled themselves before their constituents, for they also became afraid, and appointed a board of health to inform the people of the appearance of the Cholera, and to note its ravages.

7. And they also issued a most gracious proclamation, wherein it was commanded, under a penalty, that all the disciples of Ã†sculapius, should report to them the number of their patients, yea, even to a man, so that they might number them.

8. Now there was one Cyrenus, a master of the healing art, whose age, and former services caused him to be respected and beloved by the people, for he was a pattern after an honest man's heart, and the people besought him to administer his healing balms to the afflicted, and he did so, and they waxed well, for he was a benevolent man.

9. And it came to pass, as Cyrenus reported the number of his sick to the Board, that Josiah, John, Lucien, and Bryant, who was of his same profession hooted at him, and called him an old empirick, and sought to inflame the people against him, for they were jealous of, and hated him.

10. About this time Lewis, Sur named the Professor, and Haskins the Doctor who were the learned men of the Board, arose took their Chariots, and went around about the city to examine, and pronounce with great learning, upon the distempers that afflicted Cyrenus's patients.

11. Now when they returned unto the people who were awaiting them, they reported as follows, that one patient they found seated with a girl on his lap. now [p. (1) ends] Professor Lewis, with great science, classed his malady, and pronounced it after the tecknicks of his profession a concussion of blood in the heart, comonly [sic] called love sickness. another one they found laying in great stupor, so they felt of his pulse, and pronounced it Beastification, by the vulgar called beastly drunk;

12. Another one they found, who acted as man never did before, for he writhed, tumbled and shouted, and called upon the name of his maker for help, Lewis, the Professor, after great research and consultation with Haskins the learned doctor, pronounced it with great mistical learning, a religious mania, caused by a useless inquiry into the affairs of Heaven.
