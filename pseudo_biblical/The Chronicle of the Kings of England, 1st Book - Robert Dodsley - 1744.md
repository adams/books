The Chronicle of the Kings of England, Written in the Manner of the Ancient Jewish Historians

PREFACE

NATHAN BEN SADDI, a servant of God, of the house of Israel, to all and every of his readers, whether Jew or Gentile, greeting. Notwithstanding that many have taken in hand to write the History of England, it seemd good unto me also, most excellent reader, to set forth in order some things that have happened since the conquest of William the Norman. Now this I have chosen to do in the manner of our forefathers, the ancient Jewish historians, as being not only the most concise, but most venerable way of writing. Howbeit, I would not that thou shouldest be offended, or take in evil part, that I have adventured to imitate those sublime originals; neither let it enter into thine heart, that I have done this thing in sport, or wantonness of wit; for verily I abount not therewith, as thou wilt undoubtedly perceive. Nevertheless, in persuiing this delectable history, thou wilt meet with abundant matter both for information and amusement, and peradventure also for instruction. And it shall come to pass when thou readest of the foolish kings that have ruled the land, then shall thy soul be troubled, and thou shalt say within thyself, How small a portion of sense sufficeth to govern a great kingdom! But when thou readest of the kings that were wise and great, then shall thy heart be glad, and thou shalt compare the passed times with the prsent, and rejoice therein, and laugh exceedingly. Moreover thou wilt find, that the end of the first was bitterness and shame, but the end of the last was glory and honour: These shall be set up as a light unto kings in all ages, but those as a warning from generation to generation.

THE
CHRONICLE
OF THE
KINGS OF ENGLAND.

I. WILLIAM the Conqueror.

Now it came to pass in the Year One thousand sixty and six, in the Month of September, on the eighth Day of the Month, that William of Normandy, surnamed the Bastard, landed in England, and pitched his Tent in a Field near the Town of Hastings.

Then Harold the king, attended by all his nobles, came forth to meet him with a numerous army, and gave him battle.

And it was fought from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same.

But the Lord gave up Harold into the hands of his enemies, and he was pierced with an arrow, and his army was routed with exceeding great slaughter.

Then William the Bastard took on him the royal robes, and the sceptre and the diadem, and was made king of England, and was called the conqueror.

And he seized the coffers of king Harold; and the gold, and the silver, and the precious stones, and all the treasures he distributed to his followers.

And he built a strong castle and he fortified it with a wall and a ditch; and it is called the Tower of London unto this day.

And he subdued the land, and subjected it unto him; and that they might not rebel against him, he despoiled his subjects of all manner of instruments of war.

And he caused a survey to be taken of all the lands in the kingdom, and how much appertained to each eprson, which he wrote in a book called Doomsday-book.

And he raised a tribute from every one, according to his substance, and oppressed them greatly.

Moreover he made a law, and caused it to be observed throughout the whole kingdom, that at the ringing of a bell, all his subjects, from the greatest even unto the least, should extinguish their fires, and suffer no light to appear in their houses upon pain of death.

So it was called the curfew-bell; and at the sound thereof the lights were extinguished, and our fathers slept in the dark.

These are the acts of William the Bastard; who, after he had reigned twenty and one years, died, and was buried in his own tomb at Rouen, in Normandy, and Rufus, his son, reigned in his stead.

II.--WILLIAM RUFUS.

Now Rufus was thirty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned over England twelve years and ten months, and his mother's name was Matilda.

And he was a very wicked man, and his heart was set to do live continually ; and he contemned the gods of his fathers, and believed not ; he banished all the priests, and converted the sacred revenues to his own use.

Wherefore the Lord smote him with sickness, and his sickness seemed unto death.

Then his heart trembled within him, and he repented him of his sin; and he sent for the high priest, and besought him, saying,

I have done evil in the sight of the Lord, in seizing the vacant bishopricks; wherefore now, I pray thee, take back the things which belong to the church, that it may be well with me, and that my soul may live.

Howbeit, when the sickness left him, he forgot all that he had promised, and returned to his evil ways.

Nevertheless he was a valiant prince, and he fought against the Welch, and discomfited them, and drove them into the mountains, and conquered the southern part of the country.

And Malcolm also, king of the Scots, made war upon him; but he slew him in battle, and put his army to flight.

And in these days were great divisions in the church, and Urban the pope bethought himself how he might put an end to them; and he sent messengers to all the princes of Christendom, saying, Behold now, O ye Christian princes, the infidels have taken the city of Jerusalem, even the city of our God; they have possessed themselves of the holy land, and profaned the sacred places: wherefore now, I pray ye, let us unite together, and drive them from the face of the earth, to the end that the holy city may be delivered from the pollutions of evil-doers, and from the scorn of unbelievers.

So all the Christian princes united together, and raised a numerous army; and they distinguished themselves by a red cross, which they were on the upper garment, wherefore this expedition was called the Crusade; and they marched into Palestine, and besieged the holy city, and took it.

And it came to pass in those days, that the sea overflowed its banks, insomuch that great part of the lands of Earl Godwin, in Kent, were overwhelmed and lost in the sea; and the place is called Godwin's Sands unto this day.

And Rufus builded a great hall, the like of which had not been seen in England; the length thereof was two hundred and seventy feet, and the breadth thereof was seventy and four feet; and he called it Westminster Hall.

And it came to pass on a certain day, as he hunted in the forest which his father had made, that he was slain with an arrow; and his body was carried in a cart to the city of Winchester, and was beried there: and Henry, his brother, reigned in his stead.

III.--Henry I.

Now Henry was a learned man, and a prince of exceeding great wisdom, insomuch that he was surnamed Beauclerk; and he set himself to enact good laws, and to govern the people wisely.

And he restored to the English the privilege of having lights in their houses after the ringing of the curfew-bell.

And he granted a charter, whereby he confirmed the rights of the church, and relinquished his claim to the vacant bishoprics; and he forgave all debts due to the crown, all offences committed before his coronation, and confirmed the statues of Edward the Confessor.

Moreover, he ordained that the length of his own arm should be the standard measure throughout the kingdom, and it is called a yard unto this day.

And he institued the high court of parliament, and assembled them together in the city of Salisbury; he apointed also the watch.

Now the rest of the acts of king Henry, the lampreys that he ate, and the children that he begat, are they not written in the book of Baker the historian?

And Henry reigned over England thirty and five years, and he died, and Stephen earl of Boloign reigned in his stead.
