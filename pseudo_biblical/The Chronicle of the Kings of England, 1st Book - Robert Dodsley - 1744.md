PREFACE

NATHAN BEN SADDI, a servant of God, of the house of Israel, to all and every of his readers, whether Jew or Gentile, greeting. Notwithstanding that many have taken in hand to write the History of England, it seemd good unto me also, most excellent reader, to set forth in order some things that have happened since the conquest of William the Norman. Now this I have chosen to do in the manner of our forefathers, the ancient Jewish historians, as being not only the most concise, but most venerable way of writing. Howbeit, I would not that thou shouldest be offended, or take in evil part, that I have adventured to imitate those sublime originals; neither let it enter into thine heart, that I have done this thing in sport, or wantonness of wit; for verily I abount not therewith, as thou wilt undoubtedly perceive. Nevertheless, in persuiing this delectable history, thou wilt meet with abundant matter both for information and amusement, and peradventure also for instruction. And it shall come to pass when thou readest of the foolish kings that have ruled the land, then shall thy soul be troubled, and thou shalt say within thyself, How small a portion of sense sufficeth to govern a great kingdom! But when thou readest of the kings that were wise and great, then shall thy heart be glad, and thou shalt compare the passed times with the prsent, and rejoice therein, and laugh exceedingly. Moreover thou wilt find, that the end of the first was bitterness and shame, but the end of the last was glory and honour: These shall be set up as a light unto kings in all ages, but those as a warning from generation to generation.

THE
CHRONICLE
OF THE
KINGS OF ENGLAND.

I. WILLIAM the Conqueror.

Now it came to pass in the Year One thousand sixty and six, in the Month of September, on the eighth Day of the Month, that William of Normandy, surnamed the Bastard, landed in England, and pitched his Tent in a Field near the Town of Hastings.

Then Harold the king, attended by all his nobles, came forth to meet him with a numerous army, and gave him battle.

And it was fought from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same.

But the Lord gave up Harold into the hands of his enemies, and he was pierced with an arrow, and his army was routed with exceeding great slaughter.

Then William the Bastard took on him the royal robes, and the sceptre and the diadem, and was made king of England, and was called the conqueror.

And he seized the coffers of king Harold; and the gold, and the silver, and the precious stones, and all the treasures he distributed to his followers.

And he built a strong castle and he fortified it with a wall and a ditch; and it is called the Tower of London unto this day.

And he subdued the land, and subjected it unto him; and that they might not rebel against him, he despoiled his subjects of all manner of instruments of war.

And he caused a survey to be taken of all the lands in the kingdom, and how much appertained to each eprson, which he wrote in a book called Doomsday-book.

And he raised a tribute from every one, according to his substance, and oppressed them greatly.

Moreover he made a law, and caused it to be observed throughout the whole kingdom, that at the ringing of a bell, all his subjects, from the greatest even unto the least, should extinguish their fires, and suffer no light to appear in their houses upon pain of death.

So it was called the curfew-bell; and at the sound thereof the lights were extinguished, and our fathers slept in the dark.

These are the acts of William the Bastard; who, after he had reigned twenty and one years, died, and was buried in his own tomb at Rouen, in Normandy, and Rufus, his son, reigned in his stead.

II.--WILLIAM RUFUS.

Now Rufus was thirty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned over England twelve years and ten months, and his mother's name was Matilda.

And he was a very wicked man, and his heart was set to do live continually ; and he contemned the gods of his fathers, and believed not ; he banished all the priests, and converted the sacred revenues to his own use.

Wherefore the Lord smote him with sickness, and his sickness seemed unto death.

Then his heart trembled within him, and he repented him of his sin; and he sent for the high priest, and besought him, saying,

I have done evil in the sight of the Lord, in seizing the vacant bishopricks; wherefore now, I pray thee, take back the things which belong to the church, that it may be well with me, and that my soul may live.

Howbeit, when the sickness left him, he forgot all that he had promised, and returned to his evil ways.

Nevertheless he was a valiant prince, and he fought against the Welch, and discomfited them, and drove them into the mountains, and conquered the southern part of the country.

And Malcolm also, king of the Scots, made war upon him; but he slew him in battle, and put his army to flight.

And in these days were great divisions in the church, and Urban the pope bethought himself how he might put an end to them; and he sent messengers to all the princes of Christendom, saying, Behold now, O ye Christian princes, the infidels have taken the city of Jerusalem, even the city of our God; they have possessed themselves of the holy land, and profaned the sacred places: wherefore now, I pray ye, let us unite together, and drive them from the face of the earth, to the end that the holy city may be delivered from the pollutions of evil-doers, and from the scorn of unbelievers.

So all the Christian princes united together, and raised a numerous army; and they distinguished themselves by a red cross, which they were on the upper garment, wherefore this expedition was called the Crusade; and they marched into Palestine, and besieged the holy city, and took it.

And it came to pass in those days, that the sea overflowed its banks, insomuch that great part of the lands of Earl Godwin, in Kent, were overwhelmed and lost in the sea; and the place is called Godwin's Sands unto this day.

And Rufus builded a great hall, the like of which had not been seen in England; the length thereof was two hundred and seventy feet, and the breadth thereof was seventy and four feet; and he called it Westminster Hall.

And it came to pass on a certain day, as he hunted in the forest which his father had made, that he was slain with an arrow; and his body was carried in a cart to the city of Winchester, and was beried there: and Henry, his brother, reigned in his stead.

III.--Henry I.

Now Henry was a learned man, and a prince of exceeding great wisdom, insomuch that he was surnamed Beauclerk; and he set himself to enact good laws, and to govern the people wisely.

And he restored to the English the privilege of having lights in their houses after the ringing of the curfew-bell.

And he granted a charter, whereby he confirmed the rights of the church, and relinquished his claim to the vacant bishoprics; and he forgave all debts due to the crown, all offences committed before his coronation, and confirmed the statues of Edward the Confessor.

Moreover, he ordained that the length of his own arm should be the standard measure throughout the kingdom, and it is called a yard unto this day.

And he institued the high court of parliament, and assembled them together in the city of Salisbury; he apointed also the watch.

Now the rest of the acts of king Henry, the lampreys that he ate, and the children that he begat, are they not written in the book of Baker the historian?

And Henry reigned over England thirty and five years, and he died, and Stephen earl of Boloign reigned in his stead.

IV.--STEPHEN.

AND Stephen was a goodly man, and a man of great valour; howbeit, as he was not the rightful heir, he bethought himself how he might best obtain the affections of the people; and he sought by all manner of ways to please them.

To the nobles he gave leave to build them forts and castles on their own lands; he won favour with the priests by exempting them from temporal authority; the gentry he pleased with leave to hunt in his forets; and he pleased the people with freeing them from taxes and impositions.

Nevertheless his reign was full of trouble; the word was not sheathed, neither ceased he from war all the days of his life.

And now the sin of laziness began to prevail in the land, and the great men and the nobles made unto themselves coaches and chariots, and were drawn through the streets of the city with horses; moreover, their pride increased daily, insomuch that in process of time they were carried on the shouldres of men, and blushed not.

And Stephen reigned over England eighteen years and nine months, and he died; and Henry Plantagenet reigned in his stead.

V.--HENRY II.

AND Henry was tenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over England four and thirty years and eight months, and his mother's name was Maud.

And he chose unto himself wise and discreet counsellors of state, he appointed learned and able men to reform abuses in the laws, he disbanded also the foreign army which his father had kept, and utterly destroyed the castles and forts which the nobles and prelates had built in his reign.

And it came to pass, that grievous complaints were made unto the king of divers cruel offences and enormous crimes committed by the clergy, occasioned by their being exempted in the former reign from the civil power, and encouraged as was said, by the connivance of Becket the high priest.

And the king assembled the priests and the elders together, and he said unto them, Is not it meet that this law should be abolished? and they answered him and said, It is meet.

Then Becket the high priest stood up, and opposed the king with great haughtiness, and refused his assent.

And the wrath of the king was kindled against him, and he caused him to be accused of divers crimes and misdemeanors, and he was condemned by the priests and elders, as a perjured man and a traitor.

Then Becket fled from the presence of the king, and became a fugitive in the land of Gaul.

And it came to pass after some time, that the king was reconciled to Becket, and he sent for him, and took him again into favour, and restored unto him all the honours that he before enjoyed.

Howbeit the pride of his heart was not a jot abated, he burned with choler, and cast about how he might revenge himself on his enemies.

And he suspended some, and some he excommunicated, and became in all respects more insolent than before.

Then certain of the priests and the nobles came unto the king, and complained of Becket, saying, O king! the man whom thou forgavest is now more wicked than he was before, his crimes are increased seven-fold.

Then the king waxed exceeding wrath, and his countenance changed, and he cried out, O wrteched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this turbulent priest?

Now this saying was heard by certain of the king's servants, and they went forth privily, and finding the high priest at the altar, they fell on him and slew him, and dashed out his brains at the foot of the altar, and his blood stained the holy place.

And the priests were inflamed with fury, and they sent unto the pope, accusing the king for murder of Becket.

And when the messengers came unto the presence of the pope, they bowed down with great reverence before him, saying,

O most holy father! to whom all power in heaven and earth is given, who art appointed over empires and nations to bind their kings in chains and their nobles, in fetters of iron; behold and see how the boar of the wood hath rooted up the vineyard of the Lord of sabaoth! If the rage of tyranny shall embrue with blood the Sanctum Sanctorum, what place shall be safe? Wherefore, O most mild keeper of the walls of Jerusalem, arm all the ecclesiastical power you may, unsheat the sword of Peter, and revenge the death of this holy martyr, whose blood crieth out for all the church, and whose divine glory is already revealed by miracles.

And the pope was moved exceedingly, and he sent unto the king, commanding him to purge himself of the crime laid to his charge.

And Henry protested his innocence, but it availed not: the words he had spoken testifed against him, and he was compelled to expiate his fault by penance at the tomb of Becket.

Now the pennance enjoined was this: he clothed himself in woollen, and journeyed till he came within sight of the church wherein Becket was slain.

Then he alighted from his horse; and pulling his shoes from his feet, he walked barefoot till he came to the tomb where the holy man was laid, and he prostrated himself before the shrine, and prayed, and offered rich gifts.

Moreover he unclothed himself and received discipline from the hands of the monks; and they strake him with rods, that the blood ran from his shoulders.

And the fame of Becket waxed great, and he was canonized, and miracles were wrought at his tomb.

And of the miracles that he wrought, is it not recorded, how he rose from the coffin and lighted the candles at his own burial? and when the funeral ceremony was ended, how he lifted up his head and blessed the people?

He that believeth, let him believe still; and he that doubteth, let him doubt and be damned.

And Henry was a great prince, and he conquered the kingdom of Ireland, and added it to his dominions.

Now the rest of the acts of king Henry, the concubine that he kept in the bower of Woodstock, and how she was poisoned by Eleanor the Queen, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of England?

And Henry slept with his fathers, and Richard his son reigned in his stead.

VI.--RICHARD I.
