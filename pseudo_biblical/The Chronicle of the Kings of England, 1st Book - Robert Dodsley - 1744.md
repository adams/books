PREFACE

NATHAN BEN SADDI, a servant of God, of the house of Israel, to all and every of his readers, whether Jew or Gentile, greeting. Notwithstanding that many have taken in hand to write the History of England, it seemd good unto me also, most excellent reader, to set forth in order some things that have happened since the conquest of William the Norman. Now this I have chosen to do in the manner of our forefathers, the ancient Jewish historians, as being not only the most concise, but most venerable way of writing. Howbeit, I would not that thou shouldest be offended, or take in evil part, that I have adventured to imitate those sublime originals; neither let it enter into thine heart, that I have done this thing in sport, or wantonness of wit; for verily I abount not therewith, as thou wilt undoubtedly perceive. Nevertheless, in persuiing this delectable history, thou wilt meet with abundant matter both for information and amusement, and peradventure also for instruction. And it shall come to pass when thou readest of the foolish kings that have ruled the land, then shall thy soul be troubled, and thou shalt say within thyself, How small a portion of sense sufficeth to govern a great kingdom! But when thou readest of the kings that were wise and great, then shall thy heart be glad, and thou shalt compare the passed times with the prsent, and rejoice therein, and laugh exceedingly. Moreover thou wilt find, that the end of the first was bitterness and shame, but the end of the last was glory and honour: These shall be set up as a light unto kings in all ages, but those as a warning from generation to generation.

THE
CHRONICLE
OF THE
KINGS OF ENGLAND.

I. WILLIAM the Conqueror.

Now it came to pass in the Year One thousand sixty and six, in the Month of September, on the eighth Day of the Month, that William of Normandy, surnamed the Bastard, landed in England, and pitched his Tent in a Field near the Town of Hastings.

Then Harold the king, attended by all his nobles, came forth to meet him with a numerous army, and gave him battle.

And it was fought from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same.

But the Lord gave up Harold into the hands of his enemies, and he was pierced with an arrow, and his army was routed with exceeding great slaughter.

Then William the Bastard took on him the royal robes, and the sceptre and the diadem, and was made king of England, and was called the conqueror.

And he seized the coffers of king Harold; and the gold, and the silver, and the precious stones, and all the treasures he distributed to his followers.

And he built a strong castle and he fortified it with a wall and a ditch; and it is called the Tower of London unto this day.

And he subdued the land, and subjected it unto him; and that they might not rebel against him, he despoiled his subjects of all manner of instruments of war.

And he caused a survey to be taken of all the lands in the kingdom, and how much appertained to each eprson, which he wrote in a book called Doomsday-book.

And he raised a tribute from every one, according to his substance, and oppressed them greatly.

Moreover he made a law, and caused it to be observed throughout the whole kingdom, that at the ringing of a bell, all his subjects, from the greatest even unto the least, should extinguish their fires, and suffer no light to appear in their houses upon pain of death.

So it was called the curfew-bell; and at the sound thereof the lights were extinguished, and our fathers slept in the dark.

These are the acts of William the Bastard; who, after he had reigned twenty and one years, died, and was buried in his own tomb at Rouen, in Normandy, and Rufus, his son, reigned in his stead.

II.--WILLIAM RUFUS.

Now Rufus was thirty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned over England twelve years and ten months, and his mother's name was Matilda.

And he was a very wicked man, and his heart was set to do live continually ; and he contemned the gods of his fathers, and believed not ; he banished all the priests, and converted the sacred revenues to his own use.

Wherefore the Lord smote him with sickness, and his sickness seemed unto death.

Then his heart trembled within him, and he repented him of his sin; and he sent for the high priest, and besought him, saying,

I have done evil in the sight of the Lord, in seizing the vacant bishopricks; wherefore now, I pray thee, take back the things which belong to the church, that it may be well with me, and that my soul may live.

Howbeit, when the sickness left him, he forgot all that he had promised, and returned to his evil ways.

Nevertheless he was a valiant prince, and he fought against the Welch, and discomfited them, and drove them into the mountains, and conquered the southern part of the country.

And Malcolm also, king of the Scots, made war upon him; but he slew him in battle, and put his army to flight.

And in these days were great divisions in the church, and Urban the pope bethought himself how he might put an end to them; and he sent messengers to all the princes of Christendom, saying, Behold now, O ye Christian princes, the infidels have taken the city of Jerusalem, even the city of our God; they have possessed themselves of the holy land, and profaned the sacred places: wherefore now, I pray ye, let us unite together, and drive them from the face of the earth, to the end that the holy city may be delivered from the pollutions of evil-doers, and from the scorn of unbelievers.

So all the Christian princes united together, and raised a numerous army; and they distinguished themselves by a red cross, which they were on the upper garment, wherefore this expedition was called the Crusade; and they marched into Palestine, and besieged the holy city, and took it.

And it came to pass in those days, that the sea overflowed its banks, insomuch that great part of the lands of Earl Godwin, in Kent, were overwhelmed and lost in the sea; and the place is called Godwin's Sands unto this day.

And Rufus builded a great hall, the like of which had not been seen in England; the length thereof was two hundred and seventy feet, and the breadth thereof was seventy and four feet; and he called it Westminster Hall.

And it came to pass on a certain day, as he hunted in the forest which his father had made, that he was slain with an arrow; and his body was carried in a cart to the city of Winchester, and was beried there: and Henry, his brother, reigned in his stead.

III.--Henry I.

Now Henry was a learned man, and a prince of exceeding great wisdom, insomuch that he was surnamed Beauclerk; and he set himself to enact good laws, and to govern the people wisely.

And he restored to the English the privilege of having lights in their houses after the ringing of the curfew-bell.

And he granted a charter, whereby he confirmed the rights of the church, and relinquished his claim to the vacant bishoprics; and he forgave all debts due to the crown, all offences committed before his coronation, and confirmed the statues of Edward the Confessor.

Moreover, he ordained that the length of his own arm should be the standard measure throughout the kingdom, and it is called a yard unto this day.

And he institued the high court of parliament, and assembled them together in the city of Salisbury; he apointed also the watch.

Now the rest of the acts of king Henry, the lampreys that he ate, and the children that he begat, are they not written in the book of Baker the historian?

And Henry reigned over England thirty and five years, and he died, and Stephen earl of Boloign reigned in his stead.

IV.--STEPHEN.

AND Stephen was a goodly man, and a man of great valour; howbeit, as he was not the rightful heir, he bethought himself how he might best obtain the affections of the people; and he sought by all manner of ways to please them.

To the nobles he gave leave to build them forts and castles on their own lands; he won favour with the priests by exempting them from temporal authority; the gentry he pleased with leave to hunt in his forets; and he pleased the people with freeing them from taxes and impositions.

Nevertheless his reign was full of trouble; the word was not sheathed, neither ceased he from war all the days of his life.

And now the sin of laziness began to prevail in the land, and the great men and the nobles made unto themselves coaches and chariots, and were drawn through the streets of the city with horses; moreover, their pride increased daily, insomuch that in process of time they were carried on the shouldres of men, and blushed not.

And Stephen reigned over England eighteen years and nine months, and he died; and Henry Plantagenet reigned in his stead.

V.--HENRY II.

AND Henry was tenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over England four and thirty years and eight months, and his mother's name was Maud.

And he chose unto himself wise and discreet counsellors of state, he appointed learned and able men to reform abuses in the laws, he disbanded also the foreign army which his father had kept, and utterly destroyed the castles and forts which the nobles and prelates had built in his reign.

And it came to pass, that grievous complaints were made unto the king of divers cruel offences and enormous crimes committed by the clergy, occasioned by their being exempted in the former reign from the civil power, and encouraged as was said, by the connivance of Becket the high priest.

And the king assembled the priests and the elders together, and he said unto them, Is not it meet that this law should be abolished? and they answered him and said, It is meet.

Then Becket the high priest stood up, and opposed the king with great haughtiness, and refused his assent.

And the wrath of the king was kindled against him, and he caused him to be accused of divers crimes and misdemeanors, and he was condemned by the priests and elders, as a perjured man and a traitor.

Then Becket fled from the presence of the king, and became a fugitive in the land of Gaul.

And it came to pass after some time, that the king was reconciled to Becket, and he sent for him, and took him again into favour, and restored unto him all the honours that he before enjoyed.

Howbeit the pride of his heart was not a jot abated, he burned with choler, and cast about how he might revenge himself on his enemies.

And he suspended some, and some he excommunicated, and became in all respects more insolent than before.

Then certain of the priests and the nobles came unto the king, and complained of Becket, saying, O king! the man whom thou forgavest is now more wicked than he was before, his crimes are increased seven-fold.

Then the king waxed exceeding wrath, and his countenance changed, and he cried out, O wrteched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this turbulent priest?

Now this saying was heard by certain of the king's servants, and they went forth privily, and finding the high priest at the altar, they fell on him and slew him, and dashed out his brains at the foot of the altar, and his blood stained the holy place.

And the priests were inflamed with fury, and they sent unto the pope, accusing the king for murder of Becket.

And when the messengers came unto the presence of the pope, they bowed down with great reverence before him, saying,

O most holy father! to whom all power in heaven and earth is given, who art appointed over empires and nations to bind their kings in chains and their nobles, in fetters of iron; behold and see how the boar of the wood hath rooted up the vineyard of the Lord of sabaoth! If the rage of tyranny shall embrue with blood the Sanctum Sanctorum, what place shall be safe? Wherefore, O most mild keeper of the walls of Jerusalem, arm all the ecclesiastical power you may, unsheat the sword of Peter, and revenge the death of this holy martyr, whose blood crieth out for all the church, and whose divine glory is already revealed by miracles.

And the pope was moved exceedingly, and he sent unto the king, commanding him to purge himself of the crime laid to his charge.

And Henry protested his innocence, but it availed not: the words he had spoken testifed against him, and he was compelled to expiate his fault by penance at the tomb of Becket.

Now the pennance enjoined was this: he clothed himself in woollen, and journeyed till he came within sight of the church wherein Becket was slain.

Then he alighted from his horse; and pulling his shoes from his feet, he walked barefoot till he came to the tomb where the holy man was laid, and he prostrated himself before the shrine, and prayed, and offered rich gifts.

Moreover he unclothed himself and received discipline from the hands of the monks; and they strake him with rods, that the blood ran from his shoulders.

And the fame of Becket waxed great, and he was canonized, and miracles were wrought at his tomb.

And of the miracles that he wrought, is it not recorded, how he rose from the coffin and lighted the candles at his own burial? and when the funeral ceremony was ended, how he lifted up his head and blessed the people?

He that believeth, let him believe still; and he that doubteth, let him doubt and be damned.

And Henry was a great prince, and he conquered the kingdom of Ireland, and added it to his dominions.

Now the rest of the acts of king Henry, the concubine that he kept in the bower of Woodstock, and how she was poisoned by Eleanor the Queen, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of England?

And Henry slept with his fathers, and Richard his son reigned in his stead.

VI.--RICHARD I.

AND it came to pass at the coronation of Richard, that certain of the Jews pressing in to see the ceremony, were set upon by the people with great rage and fury, and many of them were murdered.

And it was rumoured abroad, that the king had commanded that all the Jews should be destroyed; and the tumult increased exceedingly, and the Jews were destroyed in several cities of England with a terrible slaughter.

And Richard the king prepared a great army for the Holy Land; and to support this expedition, he extorted money from his subjects by all manner of ways, and the priests were instructed to preach up the great merit of this pious undertaking, and the duty of supporting it.

And he set sail for the Holy Land, with the richest and most powerful fleet that the English had ever seen; and he came to an anchor at Messina, in Sicily, on the three and twentieth day of the month of September.

And Tancred the bastard, then king of Sicily, had imprisoned Joanna, the sister of Richard, whom he had taken to wife: king Richard therefore assembled his forces together, assaulted the city, and took it.

And in his way to Jerusalem he conquered also the island of Cyprus.

And he overcame Saladin the Turk in many battles, and he took from him three thousand camels, and four thousand horses and mules: he took also the towns of Ascalon, Joppa, and Caesarea, and behaved in all things with exceeding great courage, insomuch that the glory of the king of England eclipsed the glory of all the Christian princes.

And it came to pass after he returned from the Holy Land, as he sat at meat in his palace, word was brought unto him that Philip, king of France, had laid siege to one of his towns.

Then Richard the king was exceedingly enraged, and he sware in his wrath he would not turn his face till he came to the army of Philip.

And he caused the wall of the room where he was sitting to be broken down, and he assembled his army together, and came up with the French; and the Lord fought for him, and he discomfited the army of Philip, and put them to flight, and he overthrew, with his own hand, three of the most hardy knights of France.

Wherefore he took for his motto these words, Dieu et mon droit; and this device is used by the kings of England unto this day.

And a certain outlaw, named Robin Hood, infested the forest of Sherwood in those days, insomuth that none might pass that way without his leave.

Howbeit he was a charitable thief, giving unto the poor what he took from the rich; and the blood of man he did not shed.

And Richard reigned over England nine years and nine months; and he was wounded with an arrow at the siege of the castle of Chalons, and the wound mortified, and he died thereof; and John his brother reigned in his stead.

VII.--JOHN.

AND John came not to the crown by hereditary right, he received it from the hands of Hubert the high priest, who, in his oration before the assembly of the people, declared, that, by all reason, divine and human, none ought to succeed in the kingdom, but who should be, for the worthiness of his virtues, universally chosen by the people, as was this man.

Nevertheless his virtues are not recorded, neither do we read of this his election; peradventure it was a lie.

And it came to pass that Hubert the high priest died, and Grey, bishop of Norwich, was elected by king John to succeed him.

But this election was opposed by the pope in favour of Stephen Langton, a cardinal, whom when John refused to admit, a quarrel ensued betwixt the pope and the king; insomuch that the whole nation was laid under an interdict, the king was excommunicated, his subjects were absolved from their obedience, and all divine ordinances ceased; the burying-places were shut up, the dead were cast out as dogs, and remained unberied upon the face of the earth.

Howbeit this severity brake not the spirit of John, nor humbled him a jot.

And in his wrath he sware, by the teeth of God, he would be revenged on the pope, and on all that took part with him.

Accordingly he banished the bishops from the kingdom, and confiscated the lands and goods of all the priests that obeyed the interdict.

Now when the pope perceived the stubbornness of Joh, and that the roaring of his bulls availed not; he sent messengers unto Philip the king of France, and they came unto the king, and they addressed him, saying:

O Philip, thus saith the pope: As thou regardest the remission of thy sins, assemble now thy army together, and drive out king John from the throne of England, and thou and thy sons after thee shall possess it for ever.

And Philip raised an army, and prepared to invade England.

Then John was sore troubled, and his heart smote him, and he humbled himself before Pandolphus the legate of the pope, and he took the crown from his head, and laid it at the feet of Pandolphus.

He resigned also his kingdom unto the pope, and he took an oath that he and his successors should hold it from the see of Rome, at the annual tribute of a thousand marks of silver.

Thus ended the contest betwixt the temporal and spiritual sword; and John returned to the bosom of the church, and continued a dutiful son all the days of his life.

Wherefore the holy father supported him aginst his subjects in all manner of wickedness and oppression.

And he vexed them daily with new taxes and impositions, insomuch that the barons and great men of the kingdom at length made war against him, in behalf of their rights and liberties.

Now these were called the barons' wars; and the sword of justice prevailed, and they compelled the king to confirm their ancient privileges, and he signed a charter of rights, which is called Magna Charta unto this day.

Thus wicked princes are sometimes the instruments of good to a people whom the Lord loveth.

Now the rest of the acts of king John, the bridge that he built, and his blasphemy on the buck, are they not recorded in the book of Baker the historian?

And John reigned over England eighteen years and five months, and he died; and Henry his son reigned in his stead.

VII.--HENRY III.

AND Henry was nine years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over England fifty and five years, and his mother's name was Isabel.

Now the acts of king Henry, and all the foolish things that he did, behold they are written in the book of Speed the historian.

He that hath patience to read, let him read.

And Henry lived all the days of his life, and he died, and Edward his son reigned in his stead.

IX.--EDWARD I.

AND the Lord pitched his tabernacle in the heart of king Edward, and he became a great prince, and was called Long-shanks.

And he conquered the kingdom of Wales, and overthrew Llewellen the king in battle, and slew him, and cut off his head and crowned it with ivy, and set it upon the tower of London as a terror to Wales.

And great fear came upon all Welchmen, and they submitted themselves unto Edward, and the two nations became as one people unto this day.

And it came to pass that Alexander king of Scotland died, and great contentions arose between the lords Baliol and Bruce who should be king.

And the matter was referred unto Edward, and he gave it favour of Baliol, and Baliol was made king, and did homage to Edward for his whole kingdom.

And Edward the king treated king Baliol with great haughtiness, and summoned him to appear before him on every little complaint.

Wherefore the anger of Baliol was kindled against him, and his heart swelled with indignation, and he sought how he might shake off the yoke which galled his neck.

And he sent messengers unto the pope, and got himself absolved from the oaths he had taken to king Edward, and renounced his sovereignty.

Then Edward the king raised an army, and marched against him, and the Lord gave up Baliol into the hands of his enemies, and he was taken prisoner, and carried to the tower of London.

And Edward conquered the kingdom of Scotland, and subjected it unto him; and he burnt the records of the kingdom, and he seized the crown, and the sceptre, and all the regalia, and brought them away:

And the stone also which was Jacob's pillow, and the chair of wood which enclosed it, and it is the coronation-chair unto this day.

And Edward the king enacted divers good laws and useful ordinances; and he laid great fines on many of his judges and other magistrates for their corruption; and he raised from their crimes two hundred and thirty-six thousand marks.

He banished also the Jews, to the number of fifteen thousand, and confiscated their goods.

And edward reigned over England thirty and four years, seven months, and twnety days; and he died, and Edward his son reigned in his stead.

X.--EDWARD II.

Now Edward was a wicked prince, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

And he departed from the worship of his fathers, and made unto himself two idols: and the name of the one was Gaveston, and the name of the other was Spencer.

And he set them up in his high places, and commanded them to be worshipped.

Howbeit certain of the nobles and great men of the kingdom refused to bow down before the idols, which Edward the king had set up.

And great tumults ensued, and the nobles rose up against the king, and reproved him, saying, O king, the gods which thou hast set up are idols, which we nor our fathers ever knew, neither will we worship.

Moreover they plucked them down from their high places, and dashed thim in pieces, and utterly destroyed them.

Nevertheless the king repented not, neither turned he from the evil of his ways; wherefore they took from him the crown, and the sceptre, and the royal robes, and they deposed him from the government of the kingdom, after he had reigned over England nineteen years, six months, and fifteen days; and Edward his son reigned in his stead.

XI.--EDWARD III.

AND Edward was fourteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over England fifty years, and hismother's name was Isabella.

And she took upon her the government of the kigndom during the infancy of her son: and her heart lusted after idols, and after all the abominations of her husband.

And she made unto herself an idol, and called its name Mortimer; and she fell down before it, and worshipped with great zeal day and night.

Howbeit when Edward the king became of age, he was greatly offended at the abominations of his mother: wherefore he put her in prison, and he plucked down the idol which she had set up, and he hung it on a tree, even the tree of Tyburn.

And Edward became a great and mighty king, and begat a son, and called him after his own name: moreover he was afterwards surnamed the Black Prince, and he waxed strong and valiant, and became a mighty warrior in the land.

And he fought the battles of his father, and the arm of the Lord was with him, and he conquered the kingdom of France, and took prisoner the king thereof, with his son and many of the nobles.

And Edward the king took on him the sovereignty of France, and he quartered the arms of the kingdom; and his successors are called kings of France unto this day.

And the Black Prince restored also to his kingdom Peter king of Castile, and defeated his enemies.

And his name became great over all the earth, and the princes thereof sought his friendship.

Howbeit, as it is written of old, the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, a distemper took him, and he died in the forty and sixth year of his age; and the glory of Edward his father from that time forth diminished.

In these days lived thilk grete poet, hight Geoffery Chaucere, the fader of Inglish Poesie, whose workis ben ritten in rime, and imprinted in a boke, yelyped the workis of maister Geoffery Chaucere: and he smothed the tonge of his contrie, and his fame is woxen grete in the lond.

Now the rest of the acts of king Edward, and the noble order of the garter that he instituted, behold they are written in the book of Ashmole the herald.

And Edward reigned over England fifty years, and he died, and Richard his grandson reigned in his stead.

XII.--RICHARD II.

AND Richard was a wicked prince, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, oppressing the people, and loading them with greivous impositions.

And he laid a tax on the heads of all his subjects, from fifteen years old and upwards, of what sex or condition soever, which was called the poll-tax, and it was collected with great strictness and severity.

And it came to pass, that one of the tax-gatherers came to the house of a certain tyler at the town of Deptford, in Kent, commonly called Wat the tyler, and demanded the tax for one of his daughters.

And Wat the tyler said unto him, Nay verily, but thou shouldst not demand the tax of my daughter, for the maiden is not yet fifteen years old.

Howbeit the tax-gatherer believed not the words of her father, for the virgin was fair and comely to look on.

Wherefore he stooped down, and put his hand beneath the garments of the maiden, to see if peradventure the signs of her womanhood might not appear; and he discovered her nakedness.

And the virgin was covered with shame, insomuch that she spake not a word.

But the impudence of the thing incensed her father, and his indignation kindled against the officer, and he had a hammer in his hand, with which he strake him on the head that his brains came out.

And immediately a great tumult arose, and all the people defended the action of Wat the tyler, and praised his courage: moreover they chose him for their captain, and determined to abolish the tax.

And they marched in a body and encamped on Black-Heath, and and he was joined there by Jack Straw, and their number increased to an hundred thousand men.

And a certain priest named Ball, was chaplain to the army, and he preached to the multitude from these words:

When Adam delv'd and Eve span,
Who was then a gentleman?

From hence he taught them that all men were born equal, that it was never the design of heaven that one part of mankind should be the slaves and vassals of the other; and therefore exhorted them to destroy the nobility, the clergy, the magistrates, and all who pretended to lord it over them.

With these pious resolutions they marched to London, and encamped on Tower Hill, plundering and burning the houses of all whom they thought their enemies.

And they set fire to the Temple, and burnt and destroyed the writings of all the lawyers; they burned also the palace and all the rich furniture of the duke of Lancaster in the Savoy.

And they dragged from the churches and from the altars many who had fled for refuge, and slew them in the streets.

And they strake off the head of Simon Sudbury, archbishop of Canterbury, and Hales the high treasurer, and many more, on Tower-Hill.

Then the King sent messengers unto them, desiring to know what they would have: and Wat the tyler demanded to speak with the King in person.

Then Richard the King, attended by many of his nobles, and the mayor and the aldermen of London, went forth to meet him, and they met him in Smithfield.

And he behaved with great arrogance, and his demands were so extravagant that the King knew not what answer to make unto him.

Moreover he commanded the squire who held the sword of teh King to deliver it to him: howbeit the squire took courage and refused to deliver it, saying, The sword of a King would ill become the hand of a knave.

Now Wat the tyler was vexed at this saying, and he advanced with his sword to slay the squire.

Then William Walworth, the mayor of London, was exceedingly enraged at the insolence of the tyler, and he stepped forth, and smote him with a dagger that he died: wherefore the dagger was added to the arms of the city.

Thus ended the insurrection of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw; and all the rabble returned each to his own house.

And Richard the King made unto himself idols, as Edward the second his predecessor had done: and the thing which he did, displeased the people, and they took the crown from off his head, and put it on the head of Henry duke of Lancaster, the son of John the Gaunt.

XIII.--HENRY IV.

AND Henry was thirty and three yeasr old when he began to reign and he reigned over England thirteen years, five months, and one and twenty days.

And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as most of his fathers had done.

Howbeit he made an act for burning of heretics; and they that could not believe as the church commanded, were tied to a stake till the flames consumed them: and for this he was called by the priests and the monks, the writers of that time, a pious and religious prince.

And he was seized with an apoplexy, and he died, and Henry his son reigned in his stead.

XIV.--HENRY V.

AND Henry was a valiant prince, and a great warrior.

And he laid claim to the crown of France, and marched into the kingdom with an army of thirty thousand men, taking the twon of Harfleur, with many other strong towns.

And he defeated the French army at the battle of agincourt, and slew to the number of sixty thousand men. And the Lord fought for him, and the whole kingdom was given into his hands, and he apopinted John Duke of Bedford the regent thereof.

And it came to pass that the doctrines of Wickliffe the preacher, who had been condemned by the church as an heretic, began now to spread over England, and prevailed much.

And the tenets he taught were these: That the bread and wine, in the sacrament of the alter, still continued to be bread and wine after the consecration of the priest; that the worship of images was idolatry, and a great sin; that pilgrimages, penances, and confessions to the priests were not at all necessary to salvation, but only a good life.

Now these were esteemed detestable doctrines, and damnable heresies.

And great fear came upon all priests, lest the eyes of the people should be opened, and their craft exposed: wherefore they besought the King that he would join with them in extirpating out of the land all who should teach or profess these dangerous truths.

And Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, a man of virtue and great reputation, with Sir Robert Acton, and many others, were hanged and burnt in Smithfield for professing the same.

Thus truth was defeated, and ignorance again prevailed in the land, the priests and the levites triumphed, and the minds of the people were clothed in darkness, and fed with error.

Now the rest of the acts of King Henry, and all that he did, are they not written in the books of the chronicles of the kings of England?

And Henry reigned over England thirty and four years, and he died, and Henry his son reigned in his stead.

XV.--HENRY VI.

AND Henry was eight months old when he began to reign, and he reigned over England thirty and nine years, and his mother's name was Catharine.

And in him was fulfilled what was written of old, Woe to that nation whose king is a child; for he proved a weak and unfortunate prince, losing, by his misconduct, all that Henry his father had won.

And in these days there appeared a false prophetess, named Joan of Arc; and she called herself the maid of God, and pretended to be sent from heaven to deliver the kingdom of France from the English yoke.

And she wrought miracles, and performed many wondrous things.

She raised also siege of Orleans, and defeated the English wherever she came, insomuch that the French believed her to be conducted by the finger of God; but the English thought her sent from the devil, and the soldiers began to be terrified at her presence.

Howbeit, she was at length taken by the English at the city of Roan, in Normandy; and she was convicted of witchcraft, and they burnt her there, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

In this reign began the cruel war betwixt the two houses of York and Lancaster, where brother fought with brother, the father against his son, and the son against his father, till the rivers flowed with the blood thereof, and rage and slaughter made desolate the land.

At length Edward Plantagenet, duke of York, having overthrown the king in many battles, and taken him prisoner, deposed him from the government, and was crowned king of England.

XVI.--EDWARD IV.

AND Edward was nineteen years old when he came to the crown, and he was tall and well favoured, and of an exceeding graceful presence.

Moreover he was a prince of great courage and wisdom, and he set himself to enact good laws, and to reform the abuses in his government.

And he sate in the court of justice three days himself, that he might be a witness how his laws were executed.

And many more good qualities had Edward; howbeit he lusted after women exceedingly, and he was a gallant prince, and young and handsome to look on, wherefore the hearts of the ladies were in his hand.

And it came to pass that Matthew Shore, a goldsmith in London, had taken to wife the most beautiful virgin in all the city.

And the fame of her beauty reached the ears of the king, and he disguised himself as a merchant, and went to the house of Shore pretending to buy jewels.

And when he saw how exceeding fair she was, even beyond what fame had reported unto hi, his heart was smitten with love, and he burned to enjoy her.

Wherefore he discovered himself, and took her home to his bed, and she lived in adultery with him all the days of his life.

In his reign was born Thomas Parr, of the county of Salop, who lived during the reign of ten kings, even to the days of king Charles I, when he died, being an hundred fifty and two years old.

Moreover he did penance for the sin of fornication at the age of an hundred years.

And Edward reigned twenty and three years, and he died, and was buried in his own tomb at Windsor, and Edward his son reigned in his stead.

XVII.--EDWARD V.

AND Edward was eleven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over England nine weeks and three days, and was murdered in the twoer by his uncle Richard, the crooked duke of Gloucester.

XVIII.--RICHARD III.

AND Richard took on him the government of the kingdom, and set the crown upon his own head.

And in order to clear his way to the throne, and secure to himself the possession thereof, he murder'd all who stood in his way.

Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against him, and he smote him by the hand of Henry earl of Richmond, of the house of York, and he died in the field of battle, even Bosworth field.

Thus ended the war betwixt the two houses of York and Lancaster, after twelve pitched battles had been fought, in which there were slain two kings, one prince, ten dukes, two marquisses, twenty-one esquires, and eighty-four thousand nine hundred ninety and eight private soliders.

And they took the crown from the head of king Richard, and put it on the head of Henry earl of Richmond; and all the army shouted for joy, and they cried out, Long live king Henry the Seventh.

And the body of Richard was found in the field of battle, and they laid it on a horse, and brought it to the city of Leicester, and it was buried there, and Henry of Richmond reigned in his stead.

XIX.--HENRY VII.

Now Henry was a wise and politic prince, and he set himself, by all manner of ways, to secure the throne to himself and his successors for ever.

And he extorted from his subjects great sums of money, and filled his coffers, and the whole study of his life was to heap up riches.

To this end he made use of two men, and the name of the one was Empson, and the name of the other was Dudley.

And he gave them power and authority to plunder and oppress his subjects; and they exercised all manner of injustece upon them, accusing the innocent of crimes, and amercing and fining them in great sums without trial, converting law and jsutice into rapine and cruelty.

Now whether it were out of an affectation of state and grandeur, or peradventure that he feared some sudden attempt upon his person (for he was not beloved of the people) he appointed a band of tall men to attend him, called the yeomen of the guard, which all the kings of England since have kept unto this day.

And in his reign there arose two impostors one after the other, laying claim to the crown of England.

And the name of the one was Simnel, a baker's son; and the name of the other was Perkin Warbeck; each pretending to be Richard duke of York, brother to king Edward the fifth.

Howbeit the first was quickly suppressed, and after having been crowned king in Dublin, had the honour to be made king Henry's turnspit.

As to the other, after many honours done him in the courts of France, Spain, Scotland, as a prince of the royal blood, he was at last advanced to the pinnacle of Tyburn.

And in these days a strange disease arose, and was called teh sweating sickness; and it continued for the space of a month, and sweapt away great numbers.

But woe unto you whoremongers, adulterers, and fornicators, and woe unto you harlets and street-walkers, that lie in wait for prey, and spread your nets in every corner; for a disease hath stricken ye through the reins, and the heat of your lusts shall burn ye up.

Now the rest of the acts of king Henry, and the magnificent chapel that he built, are they not written in the book of Bacon the historian?

And Henry reigned over England twenty and three years, and eight months, and he died, and Henry his son reigned in his stead.

XX.--HENRY VIII.

And Henry was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over England thirty and eight years, and his mother's name was Elizabeth.

And he gat the love of his subjects in the beginning of his reign by causing to be exected as traitors and oppressors, those wicked instruments of his father, Empson and Dudley.

Moreover he was favour in their eyes, by spending among them in balls and shows, and sumptuous feasts, those immense treasures which had been drained from them, and hoarded up in the coffers of his father.

And in these days the iniquity of the popedom was arrived at its full height, insomuch that indulgences for all manner of crimes were publicly sold for money; and all kinds of people, how vile and profligate soever, were promised everlasting happiness on purchasing them.

Now the impiety of these things provoked the indignation of Martin Luther, and he exposed the absurdity of them in many books. Moreover, he censured the usurpation of the pope, and made a mock of his authority.

Then Henry the king, in the zeal of his heart, wrote an answer to Martin Luther, defending the pope; and from henceforth he and his successors are honoured with the title of Defender of the Faith.

Howbeit he afterwards threw off the pope's authority, and departed from many of the errors of the church of Rome.

Whereof the thunder of the pope was levelled against him, and he was excommunicated: his subjects were absolved from their obedience, and all the princes of Europe were excited to make war upon him.

But Henry was beloved at home, and feared abroad; wherefore the thunder of the pope was despised, neither was he terrified with all the fiery bolts of his wrath.

And Henry made unto himself a great idol, thelikeness of which was not in heaven above, nor in the earth beneath. And he reared up his head unto the clouds, and extended his arm over all the land.

His legs also were as the posts of a gate, or as an arch stretched forth over the doors of all the public offices in the land; and whosoever went out, or whosoever came in, passed beneath, and with idolatrous reverence lift up their eyes, and kissed the cheeks of the postern.

And all the people, both small and grat, fell down before him, and worshipped; for they feared his power.

Priests also and bishops brought him water to wash, and dukes and nobles held the towel.

Howbeit he fell down from the pinnacle of his greatness, and was dashed in pieces even as a potter's vessel. Wherefore let him that standeth, take heed lest he fall.

And Henry was a gracious king, but a tyrannical husband.

And he took unto himself six wives, but they pleased him not; wherefore he accused them of incontinence and divers crimes, and put them away. Moreover, he beheaded some, and some he put in prison, and he dealt cruelly with them.

And it came to pass, when a certain priest in one of his sermons defended the king in this matter, that all the women in the town rose up against him, and they stoned him with stones, and drove him from amongst them.

Now the rest of the acts of king Henry, and all that he did, are they not written in the books of the chronicles of the kings of England?

And Henry was a man of great parts and much experience, and could penetrate very far into hidden things; yea, so great was the opinion of his capacity, that the measure of his abilities is preserved in the twoer of London unto this day; and it behoveth all men to humble themselves before him, and confess his superior greatness.

And Henry slept with his fathers, and Edward his son reigned in his stead.

XXI.--EDWARD VI.

Now Edward was nine years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over England six years and five months.

And he was a pious prince, and he loved the truth, and promoted the reformation which Henry his father had begun.

Howbeit he was cut off as a flower in its bud, or as a rose in the morning sun; his days also were as a span, and the years of his reign as a shadow that passeth away; but his memory smelleth sweet for ever.

And he appointed for his successor the lady Jane Grey, and she was proclaimed queen; but the part of Mary prevailing, Jane was beheaded in the Tower of London, and Mary her sister reigned in her stead.

XXII.--MARY.

AND Mary adhered to the church of Rome, and she revived the errors thereof, and restored all the ancient forms and foolish ceremonies.

Moreover she was of a cruel nature, and she persecuted unto death all who opposed her doctrines, and her reign stinketh of blood unto this day.

Old men and children, young men and maidens, they also that gave suck, with the infant at the breast, she burned at the stake; and the fire of persecution was not quenched all the days of herl ife:

But the vengeance of the Lord overtook her, and she was torn from the face of the earth as a bramble that choaketh the field, and her name is an abomination.

And from the time that she was crowned, to the day which the Lord smote her with sickness, was five years and four months, and she died, and Elizabeth her sister reigned in her stead.

XXIII.--ELIZABETH.

Now Elizabeth was twenty and five yeasr old when she began to reign, and she reigned over England forty and four years, four months, and seven days, and her mother's name was Anna Bullen.

And she was endowed with wisdom from above, and the spirit of the Almighty gave her understanding; she chose unto herself wise and able ministers; she hearkened unto their counsels, and she governed her kingdom with power and great glory.

The sea also was subject unto her, and she reigned on the oceans with a mighty hand.

Her admirals compassed the world about, and brought her home treasures from the uttermost parts of the earth.

The glory of England she advanced to its height, and all the princes of the earth sought her love; her love was fixed on the happiness of her people, and would not be divided.

The aera of learning was also in her reign, and the genius of wit shone bright in the land.

Spenser and Shakespeare, Verulam and Signey, Raleigh and Drake adorned her court, and made her reign immortal.

And woe unto you, Spaniards; woe unto you, ye haughty usurpers of the American seas; for at the lightning of her eyes ye were destroyed, and at the breath of her mouth ye were scattered abroad; she came upon your Armada as a whirlwind, and as a tempest of thunder she overwhelmed you in the sea.

Wisdom and strength were in her right hand, and in her left were glory and wealth.

She spake, and it was war; she waved her hand, and the nations dwelt in peace.

Her ministers were just, her counsellors were sage; her captains were bold, and her maids of honour ate beef-steaks for breakfast.

Now the rest of the acts of queen Elizabeth, and all the glorious things that she did, are they not written in the books of the chronicles of the kings of England?

And Elizabeth slept with her fathers, and she was a virgin; she tasted not of man, neither subjected she herself unto him all the days of her life.

And she was buried in the chapel of king Henry the seventh, and James of Scotland reigned in her stead.
