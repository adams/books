1. Now it came to pass, in the second year after the dedication of Kennel Hall, in the great city of Houndsburg, that the youngest son of Lemmy and Nabby, the Snuff Takers, whose name is "Sharpe," began to wax strong in the land ; and he was a cunning hunter ; his hut was hung around with Skunk Skins, and the smell of tobacco was on his chamber ladder. His "dags" sat beneath the oven, from which issued the warm odors of the woodchuck, and he sat quietly by his stump fire ; and there were none to disturb him or make him afraid.
And his wife was from the land of the east ; and she was a comely woman, and fair to look upon, and her kinsfold dwelt round about in the suburbs of the city ; and they communed often with the household of "Sharpe," and partook of his Royal Bounty.

2. And behold! an evil spirit troubled the mind of "Sharpe ;" and he arose and said unto his kinsman, "Lo we sit idle in the market place, without profit to our wives and littles ones ; let us go forth and take spoil, wheresoever it shall be found ; so shall we have abundance, and feed on the fat of the land, and our hearts shall be content therewith : and we will riot in pleasure and be happy."
And his kinsman said, "Thou hast well spoken ; let us depart while it is yet dark, and men do rest from their labors, sleeping quietly, with consciences void of offence towards their neighbors."

3. And they put the "dags" in custody ; in the "Buttery" did they tie them ; and they girded themselves with strange apparel, and took each man his Jack Knife in his hand, and ran to the sheepfold of Jeremiah, who dwelleth beside the brook that watereth the land of the south, and laid hold of the fattest of the flock. They whipped off the skin hastily ! the head also, and the entrails they cast into a pit, and raised thereon a heap of wood and stones, and sped themselves to their habitation, and did eat and drink, and make merry : and they said, "Who shall know this? Behold, this is a goodly feast !" And they licked their chops and gave the fragments to the "dags," and lay each man with his wife until the morning, which was nigh at hand ; and when they arose they said, "Tush ! who shall find out the iniquity that we have done ! !"

4. But on the morrow it came into the heart of Jeremiah to visit his flocks and his herds. And when he had numbered them they were found lacking. And he said, "Some enemy hath done this." And he assembled his kinsfolks and his neighbors, and took counsel of the elders of the land, and went into all the coasts round about, accusing the people and laying many grievous things to their charge.
Howbeit, when he could find nothing, he returned ; and every man gat him to his own house.

5. And after many days, the evil spirit again troubled the mind of "Sharpe !" his heart sunk within him and his countenance was fallen. And the evil spirit saith unto him, "Go to now, be of good cheer, and say, Behold Josiah selleth flesh in the Eastern Country : so shall he bear thine iniquity, and the curse shall depart from thee and thine house forever." And the thing pleased "Sharpe," and he made proclamation thereof in the highways and lanes of the city, and on the house tops, and in the secret places. And some believed the words which he had spoken, and some believed not.

6. Now the father of Jeremiah, whose name is Daniel, being a cunning man, was filled with wrath. And he sware by the blood which dyed the Ram Skin, and the point of the kife which drank in the blood of the slain, that he would allow no sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he should find out the workers of iniquity, and be avenged on the enemy. And he made haste to the house of the people, who were assembled with their rulers and their elders ; and called forth Josiah, and spake to him with authority and said, "Hast thou sold flesh in the Eastern Country, or no ?" And Josiah said, "I have not."

7. Then was the wrath of Daniel enkindled more than at the first, and he want to the hut of "Sharpe," and took him aside privily, and said into him, "Behold there has been sin and folly wrought in the land : Some enemy hath devoured of the flock ! and--Thou art the man."
And the spirit of "Sharpe" was troubled, and he was greatly afraid. And he said, "I have sinned, that I have shed innocent blood: but see thou, tell no man:" And he covenanted with Daniel, and gave him money. Then was the wrath of Daniel pacified, and he went to his house in peace.

8. And the people of the land were glad ; and they greeted Daniel for the wise deed that he had done ; and the people and the elders, and the strangers and the proselytes, cried out and sayd ; "This place shall no more be called Houndsburg, but "Muttonville ;" and it is called Muttonville to this very day.
Now the rest of the acts of "Sharpe ;" and the valor of "Toby," and his deed in the Hayloft of Eli ; and the wisdom of Lemmy, and the patience and virtue of Nabby ; Behold ! are they not had in remembrance by Joel the accuser ! ! !

Amen and Amen.
