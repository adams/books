Notes: Michael Linning had been clerk to the committee which saw to the construction of the monument. Designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and William Henry Playfair it was modelled on the Parthenon in Athens. Construction was started in 1826 and terminated in 1829 due to lack of funds. It was never completed. The monument was Scotland's memorial to those who died in the Napoleonic Wars. Michael Linning was the great uncle of Mathilda Linning who married Canon Skelton in 1859. Michael and Janet had no children which explains why the silver descended to the Skelton children.
