'''Pseudo-Biblicism''' is a style of writing in English that imitates the language of the King James Bible. Its popularity began in England in 1740 and spread to British North America, ending around 1830. It is also known as the "Scriptural Style", or the "Style of Ancient Antiquity".<ref>Shalev, Eran (2010) [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%22Written+in+the+Style+of+Antiquity%22%3A+Pseudo-Biblicism+and+the+Early...-a0244888045 "Written in the Style of Antiquity": Pseudo-Biblicism and the Early American Republic, 1770-1830] Retrieved August 2014.</ref>

==Motivation==

When the King James Bible was translated, its translators intentionally chose language forms that were antiquated even in its day. They did so "to create a voice of divine wisdom and truth" (Shalev 2010). Borrowing from this distinctive voice, English and American authors employed the "Style of Ancient Antiquity" as a rhetorical tool.

For instance, English authors chronicled wars in the biblical style, lending gravity to the battles in faraway lands: "[the people of Hungary] cried unto the Lord their God in their distress ... but the men of Hungary prevailed : for the Lord was on their side." (French Gasconade 1743)

Furthermore, some American authors wrote in the pseudo-biblical genre as part of a larger pursuit toward national identity: (Shalev 2010)

<blockquote>While the language of the Bible reiterated Americans' understanding of their collective mission, it also positioned politics as the new religion of the republic, a medium that sanctified the nation and constructed Americans' perception of chosenness... The pseudo-biblical language thus wove the Bible into American life and sanctified the young nation.</blockquote>

Because the bible was a cultural text with near universal familiarity in England and the Americas, pseudo-biblical publications found a niche and acted as a medium of expression for nearly a century.
