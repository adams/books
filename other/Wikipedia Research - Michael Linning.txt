'''Michael Linning, Writer to the Signet''' [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet|WS]] (1775 – 17 February 1848) was a Scottish [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet|solicitor]] who wrote [[The First Book of Napoleon]]. He was the son of Thomas Linning and grandson of the Rev. Thomas Linning, Minister of Lesmahogow.<ref>Society of Writers to H.M. Signet (1890) [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/society-of-writers-to-hm-signet-great-britain/a-history-of-the-society-of-writers-to-her-majestys-signet-electronic-resource-hci/page-22-a-history-of-the-society-of-writers-to-her-majestys-signet-electronic-resource-hci.shtml A history of the Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet]. p.22.

==Author of the First Book of Napoleon==

[[The First Book of Napoleon]] is written under the pen name "Eliakim the Scribe". A pre-publication manuscript copy at the State Library of New South Wales identifies Michael Linning as the author.<ref>http://acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/itemDetailPaged.cgi?itemID=949985</ref> As a Writer to Her Majesty's Signet, Linning's role was very similar to the ancient biblical role of [[Scribe#Judaism|scribe]]. In addition, the pen name "Eliakim" may be a [[Palindrome#semordnilap|semordnilap]] of Michael (i.e. "Mikaile").

==Inventor of Peat to Fuel Conversion==

In a history of the parish of Mid-Calder, historian Hardy M'Call describes Linning and his work on peat moss conversion to fuel:<ref>M'Call, Hardy Bertram (1894) ''[https://archive.org/details/historyandantiq01mcagoog The history and antiquities of the parish of Mid-Calder]''. Turnbull and Spears. p. 41. Archive.org. Retrieved on August 31, 2014.</ref>

<blockquote>Mr. Linning was a man of inventive mind. Among his many projects, which were to have united the welfare of mankind at large with the development of his own estate, was a scheme for the conversion of peat into portable fuel... The scene of these experiments is marked by a stone chimney, which still remains on the lands of [[Colzium]], though partially shattered by the memorable thunderstorm of 12th August 1884.</blockquote>

The patent application is recorded in February 1837.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=mNlQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA415&lpg=PA415&dq=Michael+Linning,+Clerk+to+the+Signet,+Edinburgh&source=bl&ots=HCk3FJ7ls_&sig=o1iMsxsKBrfpZ45ZmdVGp-5Iy_c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WkoDVNLMM4eMNvm1gfgM&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Michael%20Linning&f=false Mechanics Magazine and Journal of Science, Arts and Manufactures, Vol. 26] "List of Irish Patents Granted in the Month of February, 1837"</ref>

"Around 1800, Colzium and the nearby Cairns estate were owned for some period by Michael Linning, Esq., Clerk to the Signet, who lived later in Edinburgh and Chryston, Lanarkshire. Linning was described in 1838 by John Sommers, D.D., minister of Mid-Calder Parish, as "formerly proprietor of the lands of Colzium and Cairns." Sommers continued in detail concerning Linning's work in the development and use of the Water of Leith, on which the Colzium estate sits, for the benefit of the region. Linning is recorded elsewhere as Writer to the Signit. As such, he was an attorney in service to the Crown and the government. The estate is overseen by the head gardener James Martlow who was featured on BBC One Scotland's Beechgrove Garden."

"There are several quarries in the parish yielding freestone for building, and whinstone for road metal, and it is understood that the lands of Murieston have produced a large revenue to the proprietors from the limestone quarries. Bell's quarry, which has been long disused, but has given its name to the neighbouring village, may be seen by the roadside on the lands of Brucefield. The discovery of an almost inexhaustible bed of freestone at the foot of the Cairn hills was made about the year 1830 by Mr Michael Linning, who offered therefrom to the Royal Association of Edinburgh as much stone as would complete the National Monument on Calton Hill. The quarry has never been at any time extensively worked. Mr Linning was a man of inventive mind. Among his many projects, which were to have united the welfare of mankind at large with the development of his own estate, was a scheme for the conversion of peat into portable fuel, adapted for manufacturing purposes by means of compression. The scene of these experiments is marked by a stone chimney, which still remains on the lands of Colzium, though partially shattered by the memorable thunderstorm of 12th August 1884, But however correct the system may have been in theory, it proved to be unsuccessful in practice, the situation of Mr Linning's experiments being too remote from coal to afford any prospect of remunerative working."

The latter [Baadpark] he sold in 1827 to Mr Michael Linning, W.S., of Easter Colzium, but he continued proprietor of West Colzium and West Cairns until his death, which occurred on 28th August 1849, in his eighty-sixth year.

Michael Linning, W.S., of Colzium, we have already had occasion to speak (page 1 14) ; he subsequently became possessed of the lands of East Cairns and Baadpark, and died on 17th February 1838, after which his landed property in this parish was conveyed by his trustees to Robert Downie of Appin.

Interest in the Sandlodge mines was bleak thereafter. In 1828, Michael Linning of the Scottish National Mining Co. rekindled some interest in the mines, but nothing ever became of this. The abandoned mineshafts lay water filled until early 1870’s, when John Walker made his entry.

One piece of unfinished business connected with the property is that Ogscastle was bought in 1815 by Michael Linning who sponsored the Edinburgh Folly, the unfinished national monument to the heroes of the Napoleonic Wars on Calton Hill.
